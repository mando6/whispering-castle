### Part 2: True or False - Answers

**11. FALSE** - You should NEVER work on original evidence. Always work on forensic copies to preserve the original in pristine condition.

**12. FALSE** - Hash values prove that data hasn't changed, but they cannot identify who created or modified files. They verify integrity, not attribution.

**13. TRUE** - Employees may retain some privacy expectations depending on company policies, notice provided, and applicable law, even with company-owned devices.

**14. FALSE** - Forensic examiners must report ALL findings objectively, including exculpatory evidence. This is both a legal and ethical obligation.

**15. TRUE** - The Fourth Amendment generally restricts government action, not private party searches (though evidence obtained by private parties may still be subject to other legal restrictions).

### Part 3: Short Answer - Sample Answers

**16. Relationship between chain of custody and data integrity:**

Chain of custody and data integrity work together synergistically. Chain of custody documents WHO handled evidence and WHEN, creating an unbroken paper trail of possession. Data integrity verification (through hash values) proves WHAT was handled hasn't changed. Together they provide comprehensive protection: chain of custody shows the evidence wasn't switched or mishandled by people, while data integrity shows the evidence itself wasn't altered. Courts require both to admit digital evidence - chain of custody for authenticity and data integrity for reliability.

**17. Discovery of child exploitation evidence:**

Upon discovering child exploitation material, you must: (1) Immediately stop examining that material, (2) Report it to appropriate law enforcement authorities as required by mandatory reporting laws in most jurisdictions, (3) Document the discovery in your case notes, including how it was found, (4) Not continue examining the exploitation material without proper authorization, (5) Continue with your original investigation scope. The original warrant may not authorize examination of this material, so separate legal process may be needed. Most jurisdictions have mandatory reporting requirements for child exploitation material regardless of how it's discovered.

**18. Three key elements for valid consent:**

Valid consent must be: (1) Voluntary - given freely without coercion, threats, or promises, (2) From someone with authority - the person must have actual or apparent authority over the device/data being searched, (3) Informed - the person must understand the nature and scope of what they're consenting to. Additionally, consent can be withdrawn at any time, and it's best practice to obtain written consent when possible.

**19. Best Evidence Rule and digital evidence:**

The Best Evidence Rule (Federal Rule of Evidence 1002) requires that the original document be produced to prove its contents. However, for digital evidence, the Rule has been interpreted to allow properly created forensic copies. Under Rule 1001(d), a "duplicate" is admissible to the same extent as an original if it accurately reproduces the original. Forensic images verified by hash values qualify as duplicates because they are exact bit-by-bit copies. This is crucial for digital forensics since working on original evidence would violate data integrity principles.

**20. Two privacy protection techniques:**

(1) Data minimization through targeted searching - Use specific keywords, date ranges, and file type filters to search only for relevant evidence rather than examining all content. This limits exposure to irrelevant personal information. (2) Privilege review using taint teams - Have a separate team review potentially privileged material (attorney-client communications, medical records) before the main investigative team sees it. The taint team identifies and segregates privileged content, ensuring only properly discoverable evidence reaches investigators. Both techniques honor privacy while allowing thorough investigation of legitimate scope.

### Part 4: Scenario-Based - Sample Answers

**Scenario 1 Answers:**

**21. Key considerations for live vs. dead acquisition:**

Consider: (1) Volatile data needs - RAM contains encryption keys, running processes, network connections lost upon shutdown, (2) Business impact - Weigh investigative needs against economic damage, (3) Encryption status - Live systems may provide access to unencrypted data, (4) Evidence preservation - Live acquisition modifies system state more than dead acquisition, (5) Legal authority - Ensure warrant or authorization covers chosen method, (6) Technical expertise - Live acquisition requires specialized skills, (7) Documentation requirements - Live methods require more extensive justification in court. Given servers are running critical business processes and may contain volatile data, live acquisition is likely appropriate but must be well-documented.

**22. Steps for live acquisition integrity and chain of custody:**

(1) Photograph systems before touching anything, (2) Document all running processes and network connections, (3) Use forensically sound tools that minimize system changes, (4) Create hash values of acquired data immediately, (5) Use write-blockers where possible, (6) Document every command executed and tool used with versions, (7) Have witness present to observe, (8) Create detailed timeline of all actions, (9) Note any system changes made and why, (10) Immediately secure acquired data with tamper-evident measures, (11) Maintain continuous custody or document all transfers, (12) Verify hash values before beginning analysis.

**23. Essential documentation:**

(1) Business impact justification for live acquisition decision, (2) Photographs of system states, (3) Complete tool list with versions, (4) Command logs or keystroke records, (5) System state information (processes, network, memory), (6) All hash values calculated, (7) Chain of custody forms for all evidence, (8) Witness statements, (9) Timeline of actions, (10) Any anomalies or issues encountered, (11) Technical expert qualifications, (12) Case notes explaining decision-making process throughout.

**Scenario 2 Answers:**

**24. Can you examine murder evidence under drug warrant?**

Generally no, you cannot conduct a detailed examination of murder evidence under a warrant for drug trafficking. The warrant's scope is limited to evidence of the specified crime (drug trafficking). However, the "plain view" doctrine may allow seizure of obviously incriminating evidence discovered inadvertently during a lawful search within the warrant's scope. But this doesn't automatically authorize detailed forensic examination - that typically requires separate legal process.

**25. Steps regarding murder evidence:**

(1) Stop examining the murder-related material immediately, (2) Document what was observed and how it was discovered, (3) Note that examination ceased to avoid exceeding warrant scope, (4) Notify the prosecutor/requesting authority immediately, (5) They will need to obtain additional legal authority (warrant amendment, new warrant, or court order) for murder evidence, (6) Maintain separate chain of custody documentation for this evidence, (7) Do not continue examining until proper authorization obtained, (8) Continue with drug trafficking investigation within original warrant scope.

**26. Plain view doctrine application:**

The plain view doctrine requires: (1) Lawful access to the location where evidence is found - satisfied because you're lawfully searching the phone under warrant, (2) Incriminating nature of evidence is immediately apparent - depends on how obvious the murder evidence is, (3) Discovery is inadvertent - must not be deliberately seeking murder evidence. If these conditions are met, you can seize the evidence, but detailed forensic examination still requires additional authorization. The doctrine allows seizure, not exhaustive search beyond original scope. Document that discovery was inadvertent and during authorized drug trafficking search.

**Scenario 3 Answers:**

**27. Why tool validation is important:**

Tool validation ensures that forensic software performs accurately and reliably, producing consistent results. It's critical because: (1) Court admissibility - Under Daubert/Frye standards, methodology must be reliable, (2) Error detection - Validation identifies bugs or limitations, (3) Result reliability - Ensures findings are accurate not artifacts of flawed tools, (4) Professional standards - Organizations like NIST and SWGDE require validation, (5) Expert testimony - Examiners must explain and defend their tools, (6) Different versions may have different behaviors - New versions may introduce bugs or changes.

**28. Appropriate response to challenge:**

(1) Acknowledge the discrepancy in version numbers, (2) Explain why newer version was used (if there's a good reason like critical bug fix), (3) Provide validation documentation for the version actually used, (4) Demonstrate that both versions produce same results for relevant analysis, (5) Offer to re-examine evidence using specified version to confirm findings, (6) Provide peer-reviewed research on tool reliability, (7) Explain your laboratory's validation process, (8) Show that methodology, not just tool, is sound. If unable to validate the version used, this could be serious problem requiring re-examination.

**29. Documentation practices to prevent this:**

(1) Document exact tool versions used in contemporaneous notes, (2) Include tool versions in formal reports, (3) Maintain laboratory validation records for all tool versions, (4) Use version control for forensic software, (5) Create validation reports before using new versions, (6) Document reasons for tool/version selection, (7) Include screenshots showing tool versions, (8) Maintain metadata of examination environment, (9) Have standard operating procedures requiring version documentation, (10) Regular peer review of reports before finalization.

**Scenario 4 Answers:**

**30. Privacy considerations:**

(1) Remember this is personal device, not company property - higher privacy expectation, (2) Limit examination to work-related areas where possible, (3) Minimize access to intimate personal information, (4) Document consent scope clearly, (5) Consider that medical and intimate information discovered may not be covered by consent, (6) Be sensitive to viewing deeply personal content, (7) Implement data minimization - collect only what's necessary, (8) Consider having same-gender examiner for intimate materials, (9) Limit who has access to examination results, (10) Ethical obligation to respect privacy even with consent.

**31. Handling attorney-client communications:**

(1) STOP examining attorney-client communications immediately, (2) These are privileged and protected from discovery, (3) Document that such communications were discovered, (4) Do NOT read, copy, or analyze privileged communications, (5) Implement privilege screening protocol, (6) May need to use "taint team" or special master, (7) Employee should be notified, (8) Seek guidance from your organization's counsel, (9) Segregate privileged materials from examination, (10) These materials should be returned or sealed pending privilege determination. Violating attorney-client privilege is serious ethical and legal breach.

**32. Steps to limit privacy intrusion:**

(1) Use targeted keyword searches for work-related material rather than comprehensive examination, (2) Limit date ranges to relevant time periods, (3) Filter by file types relevant to investigation, (4) Create privilege/privacy filter to flag protected content, (5) Have privacy advocate or compliance officer review methodology, (6) Document all irrelevant personal information encountered and that it was not examined in detail, (7) Obtain more specific consent for areas that need examination, (8) Consider having employee identify work-related apps/areas first, (9) Minimize number of examiners with access, (10) Destroy copies of personal information after investigation concludes.

### Part 5: Case Analysis - Sample Answers

**33. Evaluation of defense challenges:**

**Challenge 1 - MD5 insufficient:** Has some merit. While MD5 is still used for integrity verification, SHA-256 is now the preferred standard. Defense may argue MD5's cryptographic weaknesses (collision vulnerabilities) undermine integrity proof. However, for forensic purposes (not security), MD5 is generally still acceptable, especially if supplemented with other documentation.

**Challenge 2 - No evidence locker access documentation:** Has strong merit. Chain of custody requires documentation of who had access to evidence at all times. Unknown access to evidence locker creates gap in chain of custody - can't prove evidence wasn't accessed or tampered with overnight. This is significant weakness in evidence handling.

**Challenge 3 - Tax returns outside time frame:** Has merit. Warrant specified January 2024 to present, but detective examined 2020-2023 returns. This may exceed warrant scope unless "related to fraudulent investment schemes" reasonably encompasses prior years' returns or plain view doctrine applies.

**Challenge 4 - Exceeded warrant scope:** Has merit. Detective was authorized to search for specific financial fraud evidence, but the examination of unrelated tax returns (especially from outside the specified time frame) and child exploitation images may exceed scope. However, plain view doctrine might apply if evidence was discovered inadvertently.

**34. What should be done differently with hash values:**

(1) Calculate BOTH MD5 and SHA-256 (or just SHA-256), (2) Calculate hash of original hard drive, (3) Calculate hash of forensic image, (4) Verify hashes match before removing original from scene, (5) Document hash values in official evidence forms, not just personal notes, (6) Re-verify hash before beginning analysis, (7) Include hash calculations in formal report, (8) Document tool used for hashing and version, (9) Photograph hash values displayed on screen, (10) Have witness verify hash process if possible.

**35. Handling child exploitation images:**

(1) Immediately cease examining that material, (2) Mandatory reporting requirement - report to appropriate law enforcement agency (likely federal given CSAM nature), (3) Document discovery in case notes including context of how found, (4) Do not continue examining without proper authorization - original warrant is for financial fraud, (5) Obtain separate warrant or legal process for child exploitation investigation, (6) Maintain separate chain of custody for this evidence, (7) Follow specialized handling protocols for child exploitation material, (8) Notify prosecutor of discovery, (9) Original investigation can continue within scope while exploitation material is reported separately.

**36. Missing chain of custody documentation:**

(1) Evidence locker access log - who accessed locker and when, (2) Transfer documentation when moving evidence from scene to lab, (3) Storage location documentation with specific locker identifier, (4) Access control records for lab facility, (5) Witness signatures for evidence transfers, (6) Temperature/environmental condition logs if relevant, (7) Any removal of evidence from locker for examination (check-out/check-in), (8) Video surveillance logs if available, (9) Verification that evidence wasn't accessed by unauthorized persons, (10) Documentation of evidence condition upon removal from locker.

**37. Admissibility of 2020-2023 tax returns:**

Potentially admissible under these theories: (1) **Plain view doctrine** - if during lawful search for current fraud evidence, prior years' falsified returns were immediately recognizable as incriminating and discovered inadvertently, (2) **Scope argument** - investigating "fraudulent investment schemes" may reasonably require examining prior years to establish pattern or scheme foundation, (3) **Related evidence** - if 2020-2023 returns directly relate to schemes continuing into 2024, they may be within scope. Prosecution would need to argue that examining prior years was reasonable step in investigating current fraud. However, defense has valid argument that warrant's specificity should limit search. Court would need to determine if search was reasonable under circumstances. Best practice would have been to include broader date range in original warrant or obtain supplemental warrant upon discovering earlier evidence.

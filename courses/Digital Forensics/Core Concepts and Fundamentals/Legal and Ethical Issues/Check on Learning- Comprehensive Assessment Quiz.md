### Part 4: Scenario-Based Questions

**Scenario 1:**

You are investigating a data breach at a company. You arrive to collect evidence from the IT server room and find several servers still running. The IT manager tells you that shutting them down could cause significant business disruption and data loss. You need to collect evidence from these systems.

**Question 21:** What are the key considerations in deciding whether to perform a live acquisition or shut down the systems for dead acquisition?

**Question 22:** If you decide to perform live acquisition, what steps must you take to ensure data integrity and maintain chain of custody?

**Question 23:** What documentation is essential in this scenario to defend your methodology in court?

---

**Scenario 2:**

You have been asked to examine a smartphone seized pursuant to a search warrant. The phone is locked with a passcode. The warrant authorizes search of the device for evidence of drug trafficking. Upon unlocking the device (through lawful means), you discover evidence of an unrelated murder.

**Question 24:** Can you examine the murder-related evidence under the original warrant? Explain your reasoning.

**Question 25:** What steps should you take regarding the murder evidence?

**Question 26:** How would the "plain view doctrine" apply in this situation?

---

**Scenario 3:**

You are conducting a forensic examination of a laptop in a civil case. The opposing attorney claims that your examination methodology is flawed because you used a newer version of your forensic software than was specified in your report, and that version had not been validated in your laboratory.

**Question 27:** Why is tool validation important in digital forensics?

**Question 28:** What would be an appropriate response to this challenge?

**Question 29:** What documentation practices could have prevented or mitigated this challenge?

---

**Scenario 4:**

You work for a corporation conducting an internal investigation into alleged employee misconduct. An employee has agreed to let you examine their personal smartphone, which they sometimes use for work. During the examination, you discover highly personal information including medical records, intimate photographs, and communications with their attorney.

**Question 30:** What privacy considerations should guide your examination?

**Question 31:** How should you handle the attorney-client communications you discovered?

**Question 32:** What steps should you take to limit the privacy intrusion while still completing your investigation?

### Part 5: Case Analysis

**Case Study:**

Read the following case summary and answer the questions:

*Detective Johnson obtained a warrant to search John Doe's home computer for evidence of financial fraud. The warrant specifically authorized search for "financial records, bank statements, and communications related to fraudulent investment schemes" from January 2024 to present. During the search, Detective Johnson created a forensic image of the hard drive and calculated an MD5 hash value, which he recorded in his notes. He took the hard drive back to the lab.*

*At the lab, Detective Johnson stored the hard drive in an evidence locker overnight. The next day, he began his examination using forensic software. While searching for financial documents, he noticed a folder labeled "Tax Returns 2020-2023" and opened it, finding what appeared to be falsified tax returns. He also discovered a folder containing images that appeared to show child exploitation.*

*Three months later, at trial, the defense attorney challenges the admission of the evidence, raising the following issues:*
1. *The MD5 hash is insufficient for proving integrity*
2. *There's no documentation of who had access to the evidence locker*
3. *The tax returns from 2020-2023 fall outside the warrant's time frame*
4. *The detective exceeded the scope of the warrant*

**Question 33:** Evaluate each of the defense attorney's challenges. Which have merit and why?

**Question 34:** What should Detective Johnson have done differently regarding the hash values?

**Question 35:** How should the child exploitation images be handled legally and procedurally?

**Question 36:** What chain of custody documentation appears to be missing from this scenario?

**Question 37:** Could the tax returns from 2020-2023 be admissible? Under what legal theory?

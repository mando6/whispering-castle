## Module 1: Introduction to Network Protocols in Forensics

### 1.1 Why Network Protocols Matter in Digital Forensics

Network protocols are the foundation of digital communication. In digital forensics, understanding these protocols is crucial because:

- **Evidence Collection:** Network traffic contains critical evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access
- **Incident Reconstruction:** Protocol analysis helps reconstruct timelines and attacker methodologies
- **Artifact Identification:** Each protocol leaves unique artifacts in logs, packet captures, and system memory
- **Attack Vector Analysis:** Understanding normal protocol behavior helps identify abnormal or malicious use

### 1.2 The Protocol Stack and Forensic Relevance

Network protocols operate in layers, and forensic investigators must understand each layer:

- **Application Layer (HTTP, DNS, SMTP):** Contains user-level data and application behavior
- **Transport Layer (TCP, UDP):** Provides connection management and data integrity information
- **Network Layer (IP):** Reveals routing, addressing, and fragmentation evidence
- **Link Layer:** Contains MAC addresses and local network topology data

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Each layer provides different forensic artifacts. Application layer protocols reveal user intent and data content, while lower layers provide routing and delivery information essential for attribution and timeline analysis.

## Module 2: TCP/IP Protocol Suite

### 2.1 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

#### 2.1.1 How TCP Functions

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery through:

**Three-Way Handshake:**
1. SYN: Client initiates connection
2. SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and responds
3. ACK: Client confirms, connection established

**Key TCP Features:**
- Sequence and acknowledgment numbers for ordered delivery
- Flow control through window sizing
- Error detection via checksums
- Connection termination through FIN/ACK exchange

#### 2.1.2 TCP in Forensic Analysis

**Forensic Artifacts:**
- Connection establishment and termination timestamps
- Sequence number analysis reveals data volume transferred
- Window size manipulation may indicate rate limiting or covert channels
- Retransmissions suggest network issues or evasion attempts

**Analysis Techniques:**
- Stream reconstruction to reassemble conversations
- Connection duration analysis for persistent threats
- Port scanning detection through SYN patterns
- Session hijacking detection via sequence number anomalies

#### 2.1.3 TCP Abuse and Attack Patterns

**SYN Flood Attacks:**
- Attacker sends multiple SYN packets without completing handshake
- Forensic signature: Numerous half-open connections
- Detection: High ratio of SYN to SYN-ACK packets

**Connection Hijacking:**
- Attacker predicts sequence numbers to inject malicious data
- Forensic signature: Duplicate or out-of-sequence packets
- Detection: Anomalous sequence number progression

**Covert Channels:**
- Data hidden in TCP options, window size, or timing

- Detection: Statistical analysis of packet timing and header fields

### 2.2 IP (Internet Protocol)

#### 2.2.1 How IP Functions

IP provides addressing and routing for network communication:

**IPv4 Header Components:**
- Source and destination addresses
- TTL (Time to Live) for hop counting
- Protocol field indicating upper-layer protocol
- Fragmentation fields for large packet handling

#### 2.2.2 IP in Forensic Analysis

**Forensic Artifacts:**
- Source IP reveals origin (with caveats for spoofing and proxies)
- TTL analysis helps identify OS and network distance
- Fragmentation patterns may indicate evasion techniques
- IP options field can contain reconnaissance data

**Geographic and Attribution Analysis:**
- IP geolocation for general attacker location
- WHOIS data for registered owner information
- BGP routing data for network path analysis
- Important caveat: VPNs, proxies, and Tor complicate attribution

#### 2.2.3 IP Abuse Patterns

**IP Spoofing:**
- Attacker falsifies source IP address
- Forensic signature: Responses to addresses that shouldn't communicate
- Detection: Ingress/egress filtering violations

**Fragmentation Attacks:**
- Overlapping fragments to evade IDS/IPS
- Forensic signature: Unusual fragment offsets and overlaps
- Detection: Fragment reassembly analysis

**Connection to Main Topic:** TCP/IP forms the foundation of Internet communication. Understanding these protocols is essential because virtually all network-based attacks and communications use this protocol suite. Forensic investigators must analyze TCP/IP to establish connections between attackers and victims, reconstruct data transfers, and identify malicious activity patterns.

## Module 3: UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### 3.1 How UDP Functions

UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides:

- Lack of acknowledgments means data loss is invisible
- Spoofing is easier due to no handshake verification
- Stream reconstruction is not possible

### 3.3 UDP Abuse and Attack Patterns

**UDP Flood Attacks:**
- Attacker sends large volumes of UDP packets

- TXT: Text information
- NS: Nameserver
- PTR: Reverse DNS lookup

### 5.2 DNS in Forensic Analysis

- Forensic signature: AXFR queries to your nameservers
- Detection: Monitoring for zone transfer attempts

**Connection to Main Topic:** DNS is critical for forensic investigations because it reveals domain access patterns, C2 infrastructure, and data exfiltration attempts. DNS logs provide valuable timeline data and can uncover malicious domains even when HTTP/HTTPS traffic is encrypted. DNS abuse techniques are commonly used by malware and attackers.

## Module 6: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

### 6.1 How SMTP Functions

SMTP handles email transmission between mail servers:

**SMTP Transaction Flow:**
```
Client: HELO mail.client.com
Server: 250 Hello mail.client.com

Client: MAIL FROM:<sender@client.com>
Server: 250 OK

Client: RCPT TO:<recipient@server.com>

Server: 221 Bye
```

**Email Headers (Forensically Valuable):**
- From: Sender address (easily spoofed)
- To: Recipient address
- Subject: Message subject

## Module 1: Foundations of Internal Threat Detection

### 1.1 What Are Internal Threats?

Internal threats (also known as insider threats) are security risks that originate from within an organization. These threats come from individuals who have authorized access to organizational resources, including:

- **Current employees** with legitimate credentials
- **Contractors and vendors** with system access
- **Business partners** with privileged permissions
- **Former employees** whose access hasn't been properly revoked

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Digital forensics provides the investigative framework and technical methods needed to identify, preserve, analyze, and present evidence of internal threat activities. While traditional security focuses on prevention, digital forensics enables detection and reconstruction of insider actions.

### 1.2 Why Internal Threats Are Critical

Internal threats are particularly dangerous because:

- **Legitimate Access:** Insiders have authorized credentials, making detection harder
- **Knowledge of Systems:** They understand security controls and potential blind spots
- **Trust Exploitation:** Organizations often have reduced monitoring for trusted users
- **High Impact:** Insiders can access sensitive data and critical systems directly
- **Evasion Capability:** They can better avoid detection mechanisms

**Statistics:**
- Internal threats account for approximately 60% of security incidents (Verizon DBIR)
- Average cost of insider incidents: $15.38 million annually per organization (Ponemon Institute, 2022)
- Detection takes an average of 85 days for malicious insiders

### 1.3 Types of Internal Threats

#### Malicious Insiders
Individuals who intentionally harm the organization through:
- Data theft or exfiltration
- Sabotage of systems or data
- Fraud and financial crimes
- Espionage for competitors or foreign entities

#### Negligent Insiders
Employees who unintentionally cause security incidents through:
- Poor security hygiene
- Falling victim to phishing or social engineering
- Mishandling sensitive data
- Violating security policies unknowingly

#### Compromised Insiders
Legitimate users whose credentials have been stolen or accounts hijacked by external attackers.

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Each type requires different forensic approaches. Malicious insiders often attempt counter-forensics, negligent insiders leave clearer audit trails, and compromised accounts show behavioral anomalies detectable through forensic analysis.

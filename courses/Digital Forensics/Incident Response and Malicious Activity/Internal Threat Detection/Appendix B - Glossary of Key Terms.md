**Anti-Forensics:** Techniques used to frustrate or mislead forensic investigations, including data destruction, obfuscation, and timestamp manipulation.

**Chain of Custody:** Documentation trail showing seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence.

**Data Exfiltration:** Unauthorized transfer or copying of data from an organization's systems to external locations.

**DLP (Data Loss Prevention):** Security solutions that monitor and control data movement to prevent unauthorized access or transmission.

**EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Security solutions providing continuous monitoring and response capabilities for endpoint devices.

**File Carving:** Forensic technique for recovering files from unallocated space without relying on file system metadata.

**Hash Value:** Cryptographic fingerprint (MD5, SHA-256) used to verify data integrity and detect modifications.

**Insider Threat:** Security risk posed by individuals with authorized access to organizational resources who may harm the organization intentionally or unintentionally.

**IoC (Indicator of Compromise):** Artifact or observable that indicates a security incident has occurred.

**Memory Forensics:** Analysis of volatile memory (RAM) to recover evidence not stored on disk.

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Platform that aggregates and analyzes security logs and events from across an organization.

**Timeline Analysis:** Forensic technique that reconstructs events in chronological order using artifacts from multiple sources.

**UBA/UEBA (User Behavior Analytics):** Technology that establishes behavioral baselines and detects anomalies indicating potential threats.

**Volatile Data:** Information that is lost when power is removed, such as system memory, network connections, and running processes.

**Write Blocker:** Device or software that prevents modification of storage media during forensic acquisition.

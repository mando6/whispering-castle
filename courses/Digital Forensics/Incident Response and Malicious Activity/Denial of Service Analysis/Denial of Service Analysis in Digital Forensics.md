## Module 1: Introduction to DoS/DDoS Attacks

### 1.1 Defining Denial of Service Attacks

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities to consume resources.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Prevents legitimate users from accessing services
- Does not typically involve data theft or system compromise
- Focuses on availability (the "A" in CIA triad)
- Can cause significant financial and reputational damage

**DoS vs DDoS:**
- **DoS (Denial of Service):** Attack originates from a single source
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** Attack originates from multiple sources simultaneously, often using botnets

### 1.2 Why DoS/DDoS Analysis Matters in Digital Forensics

**Connection to Digital Forensics:**
DoS/DDoS analysis is a critical component of digital forensics because:

1. **Attribution and Accountability:** Identifying attackers for prosecution
2. **Incident Response:** Understanding attack vectors to contain and recover
3. **Legal Evidence:** Collecting admissible evidence for court proceedings
4. **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying attack signatures for future prevention
5. **Business Impact Assessment:** Quantifying damage for insurance and legal purposes

**Forensic Challenges:**
- High volume of data to analyze
- Distributed nature obscures true attack sources
- Spoofed IP addresses complicate attribution
- Time-sensitive evidence may be lost quickly
- Need for real-time and post-incident analysis capabilities

- Legitimate traffic cannot reach destination

**Connection to Main Topic:**
Volume-based attacks are investigated by analyzing network traffic patterns, bandwidth consumption logs, and identifying the infrastructure used to generate massive traffic volumes.

### 2.2 Protocol-Based Attacks

These exploit weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocol stack.

**Common Types:**

**Connection to Main Topic:**
Protocol attacks require packet-level analysis to identify malformed requests, abnormal state transitions, and protocol violations that indicate malicious intent.

### 2.3 Application Layer Attacks (Layer 7)

These target specific applications or services with seemingly legitimate requests.

**Common Types:**
- **HTTP Flood:** Overwhelming web servers with HTTP requests
- **Slowloris:** Keeping connections open by slowly sending headers

**Amplification Attack:** DDoS technique that exploits services to generate responses larger than the initial request, multiplying attack traffic.

**Autonomous System (AS):** Collection of IP networks under common administrative control, identified by ASN.

**Baseline:** Profile of normal network or system behavior used to identify anomalies.

**Botnet:** Network of compromised computers controlled remotely to perform coordinated attacks.

**Chain of Custody:** Documentation trail showing evidence handling from collection through presentation.

**Command and Control (C2):** Infrastructure used by attackers to communicate with and control compromised systems.

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Attack originating from multiple sources simultaneously.

**Flow Data:** Network traffic metadata showing conversations between endpoints without full packet content.

**Forensic Hash:** Cryptographic checksum (MD5, SHA-256) proving evidence integrity.

**Geolocation:** Process of identifying geographic location of an IP address or device.

**Ingress Filtering:** Blocking packets with source addresses that shouldn't originate from a network segment.

**Indicator of Compromise (IOC):** Artifact or observable that suggests a security incident.

**NetFlow:** Cisco protocol for collecting IP traffic information and monitoring.

**PCAP:** Packet Capture file format storing network traffic data.

**Reflection Attack:** DDoS technique bouncing traffic off legitimate servers toward victim.

**Scrubbing Center:** Facility that filters DDoS traffic, allowing legitimate traffic to reach protected systems.

**Spoofing:** Falsifying source address or other identifying information in network packets.

**TTL (Time to Live):** Packet header field limiting packet lifetime, decremented at each router hop.

**Zero-Day:** Previously unknown vulnerability with no available patch or mitigation.

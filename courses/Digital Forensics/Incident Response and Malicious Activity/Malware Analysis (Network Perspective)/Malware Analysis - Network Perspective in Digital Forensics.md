## Module 1: Foundations of Network-Based Malware Analysis

### 1.1 Introduction to Network Forensics in Malware Analysis

Network-based malware analysis examines the communication patterns and network artifacts generated by malicious software. Unlike static or dynamic host-based analysis, this approach focuses on how malware interacts with external resources, making it essential for:

- **Detection:** Identifying infected systems through network anomalies
- **Attribution:** Tracing malware infrastructure and actor patterns
- **Impact Assessment:** Understanding what data was compromised
- **Incident Response:** Containing threats by blocking malicious communications

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Network analysis provides temporal evidence, chain-of-custody data, and artifacts that survive even after malware removes traces from infected hosts.

### 1.2 Key Network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

Network IOCs are observable artifacts that suggest malicious activity:

- **IP Addresses & Domains:** C2 servers, download locations, exfiltration endpoints
- **URL Patterns:** Specific URI structures used by malware families
- **User-Agent Strings:** Uncommon or hardcoded HTTP headers
- **Traffic Volume Anomalies:** Unusual data transfers
- **Protocol Misuse:** Non-standard protocol implementations
- **Beaconing Patterns:** Regular, periodic communications
- **DNS Queries:** Suspicious domain lookups, DGA patterns

**Connection to Core Topic:** These IOCs form the foundation for detecting the three primary network behaviors we'll study: C2 communication, data exfiltration, and propagation.

## Module 2: Command and Control (C2) Communication Analysis

### 2.1 Understanding C2 Infrastructure

Command and Control infrastructure is the communication channel between infected systems (bots) and attacker-controlled servers. This bidirectional communication allows attackers to:

- Issue commands to compromised systems
- Update malware capabilities
- Coordinate multi-system attacks
- Receive status reports from infected hosts

**Connection to Main Topic:** C2 analysis is fundamental to network-based malware investigation because it reveals the persistent communication mechanism that distinguishes advanced persistent threats (APTs) from simpler malware.

### 2.2 C2 Communication Protocols

#### HTTP/HTTPS C2

**Characteristics:**
- Blends with legitimate web traffic
- Often uses POST requests for commands
- May employ custom encoding schemes
- Cookie-based or parameter-based communication

**Analysis Techniques:**
```
# Wireshark Display Filter for HTTP POST requests
http.request.method == "POST"

# Look for:
- Uncommon User-Agent strings
- Regular intervals between requests (beaconing)
- Base64 or hex-encoded parameters
- Unusual Content-Type headers
```

**Detection Patterns:**
- High-entropy data in URI parameters
- Periodic connections to same endpoint
- Mismatched HTTP headers (e.g., claiming to be a browser but missing typical headers)

#### DNS C2 (DNS Tunneling)

**Characteristics:**
- Exfiltrates data through DNS queries
- Uses subdomains to encode information
- Can bypass many security controls
- Low bandwidth but stealthy

**Analysis Techniques:**
```
# Wireshark Display Filter
dns.qry.name contains "suspicious-domain.com"

# Indicators:
- Unusually long subdomain names
- High volume of queries to single domain
- High entropy in subdomain strings
- TXT record queries with encoded data
```

**Detection Patterns:**
- Queries with excessive subdomain length (>50 characters)
- Regular intervals between queries
- Uncommon record types (TXT, NULL, CNAME abuse)

#### Custom Binary Protocols

**Characteristics:**
- Raw TCP/UDP communication
- Proprietary encoding
- Often uses non-standard ports
- May implement custom encryption

**Analysis Techniques:**
```
# Identify unknown protocols
tcp.port != 80 && tcp.port != 443 && tcp.port != 22

# Analysis steps:
1. Identify packet structure patterns
2. Look for magic bytes or signatures
3. Analyze payload entropy (encryption indicator)
4. Correlate with process execution on host
```

### 2.3 Beaconing Detection

Beaconing refers to regular, periodic communications between malware and C2 servers.

**Statistical Analysis Approach:**

1. **Extract connection timestamps**
2. **Calculate inter-packet intervals**
3. **Identify patterns:**
   - Fixed intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds)
   - Jittered intervals (randomized within range)
   - Sleep/wake patterns

**Tool: RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics)**
- Analyzes Zeek logs for beaconing
- Uses statistical models
- Generates beacon scores

**Manual Analysis with TShark:**
```bash
# Extract HTTP conversations with timestamps
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http" -T fields \
  -e frame.time -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e http.host
```

### 2.4 Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)

DGAs generate pseudo-random domain names for C2 resilience.

**Characteristics:**
- Algorithmically generated domains
- High entropy domain names
- Large volume of NXDOMAIN responses

**Detection Methods:**

1. **Linguistic Analysis:** Compare against dictionary words
2. **Entropy Calculation:** High randomness in characters
3. **N-gram Analysis:** Character sequence patterns
4. **Machine Learning:** Train classifiers on known DGA families

**Analysis Example:**
```
# Legitimate: amazon.com, google.com, microsoft.com
# DGA: xqpmrzh.com, huifhjwe.net, ajklsdfjkl.org

Entropy calculation for domain:
H = -Î£(p(x) * log2(p(x)))

High entropy (>3.5) suggests DGA
```

### 2.5 C2 Traffic Decryption and Analysis

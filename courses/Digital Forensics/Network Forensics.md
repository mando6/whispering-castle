## Core Concepts and Fundamentals

**Introduction to Network Forensics:** Defining the field, its goals, and its role in digital investigations and security incident response.

**Network Protocols:** Understanding common protocols like **TCP/IP**, **UDP**, **HTTP**, **DNS**, **SMTP**, and how they function and can be abused or analyzed.

**Network Topologies and Devices:** Familiarity with network architecture, routers, switches, hubs, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (**IDS/IPS**).

**Legal and Ethical Issues:** Understanding chain of custody, data integrity, privacy concerns, and relevant laws (e.g., in the context of evidence collection).

## Data Acquisition and Collection

**Packet Capture** (Packet Sniffing): The process of intercepting and logging traffic passing over a digital network using tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, or specialized network taps.

**Full Packet Capture vs. Flow Data (NetFlow/IPFIX):** Understanding the difference between capturing every packet and aggregating traffic metadata.

**Data Storage and Management:** Strategies for handling the large volume of data generated by continuous monitoring (e.g., storage capacity, indexing, retention policies).

**Log Analysis:** Collecting and analyzing logs from network devices, servers, and applications (e.g., firewall logs, web server logs).

## Analysis Tools and Techniques

**Protocol Analysis:** Deep dive inspection of captured packets to reconstruct conversations, identify anomalies, and decode application-layer data (e.g., analyzing HTTP requests/responses, email content).

**Traffic Baseline Analysis:** Establishing a profile of normal network activity to effectively spot unusual or malicious traffic patterns.

**Anomaly and Signature Detection:** Using patterns (signatures) or deviations from the norm (anomalies) to identify malicious activity like malware communication or unauthorized port scans.

**Reconstruction of Network Events:** Methods for rebuilding user actions, file transfers, and application interactions from packet data.

**Steganography and Tunneling:** Detecting techniques used by attackers to hide data within legitimate traffic or use unconventional protocols to bypass defenses (e.g., DNS tunneling).

**Wireless Network Forensics:** Specific techniques for analyzing **Wi-Fi** traffic, identifying rogue access points, and breaking encryption.

## Incident Response and Malicious Activity

**Intrusion Analysis:** Identifying and characterizing the steps an attacker took within the network, often using the **Kill Chain** or **MITRE ATT&CK** frameworks.

**Malware Analysis (Network Perspective):** Analyzing network traffic to understand a piece of malware's command-and-control (**C2**) communication, data exfiltration, and propagation methods.

**Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Analysis:** Investigating the sources, targets, and methods used in network-based service disruption attacks.

**Internal Threat Detection:** Focusing on identifying unauthorized or malicious activities originating from within the organization's network.

## Cloud and Virtual Network Forensics

**Virtual Network Analysis:** Understanding how to perform forensics in virtualized environments like **VMware** or **Hyper-V**.

**Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Forensics:** Dealing with the challenges of data access and collection in cloud environments (e.g., **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**), which often involves leveraging CSP-specific logging and monitoring tools.

**Container Forensics:** Analyzing traffic and state within containerized applications (e.g., **Docker**, **Kubernetes**).

## Module 1: Introduction to Packet Capture and Digital Forensics

### 1.1 What is Packet Capture?

Packet capture (often called packet sniffing or network traffic analysis) is the process of intercepting and logging network traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network. In digital forensics, packet capture serves as a critical investigative technique to:

- Reconstruct network-based incidents
- Identify unauthorized access attempts
- Detect data exfiltration
- Analyze malware communication patterns
- Preserve evidence for legal proceedings

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Packet capture is a fundamental pillar of network forensics, one of the key disciplines within digital forensics. While disk forensics examines storage media and memory forensics analyzes RAM, network forensics focuses on data in motion. Together, these disciplines provide a complete picture of digital incidents.

### 1.2 The OSI and TCP/IP Models

Understanding network communication layers is essential for effective packet analysis:

**TCP/IP Model Layers:**
1. **Network Access Layer** - Physical transmission (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
2. **Internet Layer** - Logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)
3. **Transport Layer** - End-to-end communication (TCP, UDP)
4. **Application Layer** - Application protocols (HTTP, DNS, FTP)

**Why This Matters:** Packet capture operates primarily at the Network Access layer but must analyze protocols across all layers. Understanding these layers helps forensic investigators identify which protocol headers contain relevant evidence.

### 1.3 Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before capturing network traffic, investigators must understand:

- **Authorization Requirements** - Obtain proper legal authority (warrants, consent)
- **Privacy Laws** - GDPR, ECPA, state privacy laws
- **Chain of Custody** - Maintain evidence integrity
- **Privileged Communications** - Attorney-client, doctor-patient protections
- **Corporate Policies** - Employee monitoring agreements

**Connection to Main Topic:** Legal compliance ensures that captured packet data remains admissible as evidence. Improper capture techniques can result in evidence exclusion and legal liability.

---

## Module 2: Packet Capture Fundamentals

### 2.1 How Packet Capture Works

**Promiscuous Mode vs. Monitor Mode:**

- **Promiscuous Mode** - Captures all packets on a wired network segment that reach the network interface, not just packets destined for that interface
- **Monitor Mode** - Captures wireless packets without associating with an access point (Wi-Fi specific)

**Network Topology Considerations:**

- **Switched Networks** - Modern switches create collision domains; requires port mirroring (SPAN) or network tap
- **Hub-based Networks** - All traffic visible to all devices (rare in modern networks)
- **Wireless Networks** - Radio frequency allows passive monitoring

**Connection to Main Topic:** Understanding network topology determines where to position capture tools and what traffic will be visible. Improper placement results in incomplete evidence collection.

### 2.2 Types of Packet Capture Tools

**Software-Based Tools:**
- **Wireshark** - GUI-based protocol analyzer
- **tcpdump** - Command-line packet capture utility
- **tshark** - Terminal version of Wireshark
- **dumpcap** - Wireshark's capture engine

**Hardware-Based Tools:**
- **Network TAPs** - Physical devices that create a copy of network traffic
- **Portable Capture Appliances** - Purpose-built forensic capture devices
- **Inline Security Devices** - Firewalls, IDS/IPS with capture capabilities

**Connection to Main Topic:** Tool selection depends on the investigation context. Software tools are flexible and cost-effective, while hardware TAPs provide complete, undetectable capture for sensitive investigations.

### 2.3 Capture Filters vs. Display Filters

**Capture Filters (BPF - Berkeley Packet Filter):**
- Applied during capture to reduce file size
- Cannot be changed after capture
- Syntax: `tcpdump` style
- Example: `host 192.168.1.100 and port 80`

**Display Filters:**
- Applied to already-captured data
- Can be changed dynamically during analysis
- More powerful and flexible
- Example: `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100 && tcp.port == 80`

**Connection to Main Topic:** Forensic investigators must balance capture completeness with storage constraints. Overly restrictive capture filters may exclude critical evidence, while no filtering can create unmanageably large files.

## Module 5: Network TAPs and SPAN Ports

### 5.1 Understanding Network TAPs

**What is a Network TAP?**
A Test Access Point (TAP) is a hardware device that provides a way to access network data for monitoring purposes. Unlike port mirroring, TAPs are:
- **Passive** - No active processing or filtering
- **Reliable** - No packet loss under load
- **Undetectable** - Cannot be identified by network participants
- **Fail-safe** - Network continues operating if TAP fails

**Types of TAPs:**
- **Copper TAPs** - For Ethernet networks (10/100/1000 Mbps)
- **Fiber TAPs** - For fiber optic networks
- **Aggregation TAPs** - Combine multiple links
- **Bypass TAPs** - Allow inline device removal

**Connection to Main Topic:** Hardware TAPs are essential in high-stakes forensic investigations where complete packet capture is mandatory and detection by adversaries must be prevented.

### 5.2 Configuring SPAN/Mirror Ports

**SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) Configuration:**

SPAN allows copying traffic from one or more switch ports to a monitoring port.

**Cisco Switch Example:**
```
# Configure SPAN session
Switch(config)# monitor session 1 source interface gi0/1
Switch(config)# monitor session 1 destination interface gi0/24

# Verify SPAN configuration
Switch# show monitor session 1
```

**SPAN Limitations:**
- **Packet Loss** - Under heavy load, SPAN may drop packets
- **No Outbound Traffic** - Destination port cannot transmit
- **Performance Impact** - CPU overhead on switch
- **Detection Risk** - Visible in switch configuration

**Connection to Main Topic:** While SPAN ports are cost-effective for forensic monitoring, investigators must understand their limitations and document potential evidence gaps in reports.

### 5.3 Placement Strategies for Forensic Capture

**Strategic Capture Locations:**

1. **Internet Border** - Capture all external communications
2. **DMZ Boundaries** - Monitor public-facing servers
3. **Critical Server VLANs** - Database, file, and application servers
4. **User Network Segments** - Workstation traffic
5. **Wireless Controller** - All Wi-Fi traffic

1. **B** - FPC captures complete packets; Flow captures metadata
2. **C** - Flow data does not include payload content
3. **B** - Flow data enables longer retention periods
4. **C** - Seven characteristics define a unique flow
5. **B** - IPFIX is the IETF standard based on NetFlow v9
6. **B** - File extraction requires Full Packet Capture
7. **C** - Approximately 4 TB per day at given utilization
8. **C** - Flow shows who, when, and volume (not content)
9. **B** - Enterprise with critical infrastructure benefits from hybrid
10. **B** - Flow shows pattern; FPC reveals details
11. **D** - Both face challenges; behavioral analysis becomes more important
12. **B** - Sampling analyzes subset of packets, may miss low-volume events
13. **C** - DNS tunneling requires payload inspection
14. **B** - Privacy and legal concerns with payload capture

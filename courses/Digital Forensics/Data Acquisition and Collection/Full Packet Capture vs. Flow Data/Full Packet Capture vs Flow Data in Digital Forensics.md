## Module 1: Introduction to Network Traffic Collection

### 1.1 Why Network Traffic Analysis Matters in Digital Forensics

Network traffic analysis is a critical component of digital forensics, enabling investigators to:
- Reconstruct attack timelines and lateral movement
- Identify data exfiltration and command-and-control communications
- Validate or refute hypotheses during incident response
- Provide evidence for legal proceedings

**Connection to Main Topic:** Understanding *how* we collect network data determines *what* we can analyze during an investigation. The choice between full packet capture and flow data fundamentally shapes the scope and depth of forensic analysis.

### 1.2 The Two Primary Collection Methodologies

Network traffic can be collected in two fundamentally different ways:

1. **Full Packet Capture (FPC):** Recording every bit of data transmitted across a network segment
2. **Flow Data (NetFlow/IPFIX):** Aggregating metadata about network conversations without capturing payload content

**Connection to Main Topic:** These approaches represent opposite ends of the spectrum between completeness and efficiency. Understanding their trade-offs is essential for effective forensic data collection strategies.

## Module 2: Full Packet Capture (FPC)

### 2.1 What is Full Packet Capture?

Full Packet Capture involves recording complete network packets, including:
- **Headers:** Source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, flags
- **Payload:** The actual data being transmitted (emails, web pages, files, etc.)
- **Timing information:** Precise timestamps for each packet

**Key Characteristic:** FPC provides a complete, byte-for-byte record of network activity.

### 2.2 How FPC Works

```
[Network Traffic] → [Capture Interface] → [Packet Filter (Optional)] → [Storage]
                              ↓
                    [Wireshark/tcpdump/Zeek]
```

The capture process:
1. Network interface operates in promiscuous mode (captures all traffic, not just traffic addressed to it)
2. Packets are copied from the network segment
3. Optional BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) filters reduce capture scope
4. Packets are written to disk in formats like PCAP or PCAPNG

### 2.3 Advantages of FPC for Digital Forensics

**Complete Evidence Preservation**
- Captures all available information for retrospective analysis
- Enables deep protocol analysis and payload inspection
- Supports evidence of data exfiltration, malware communications, and attacker tools

**Flexibility in Analysis**
- Investigators can ask new questions of old data
- Protocol decodes reveal application-layer details
- File carving and extraction capabilities

**High Fidelity**
- Precise timing information for event correlation
- Can reconstruct TCP sessions completely
- Cryptographic validation of captured data integrity

### 2.4 Disadvantages and Challenges of FPC

**Storage Requirements**
- A 1 Gbps link at 50% utilization generates ~5.4 TB per day
- High-bandwidth environments require substantial storage infrastructure
- Long-term retention becomes cost-prohibitive

**Processing Overhead**
- Significant CPU and memory requirements for packet capture
- Analysis tools require substantial resources
- Packet loss can occur at high traffic volumes

**Privacy and Legal Concerns**
- Captures sensitive user data and potentially encrypted communications
- Regulatory compliance issues (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Requires careful handling and access controls

**Connection to Main Topic:** FPC's completeness comes at significant cost. This drives the need for alternative approaches like flow data in many environments.

## Module 3: Flow Data (NetFlow/IPFIX)

### 3.1 What is Flow Data?

Flow data aggregates network communications into "flows" - unidirectional sequences of packets sharing common characteristics:
- Source/destination IP addresses
- Source/destination ports
- Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- Type of Service (ToS)
- Input interface

**Key Characteristic:** Flow data captures *metadata about conversations* without recording payload content.

### 3.2 Understanding Network Flows

A **flow** is defined as a stream of packets with the same 7-tuple during a specific time period:
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Source port
- Destination port
- Protocol
- ToS byte
- Input interface

**Example Flow Record:**
```
Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Destination IP: 203.0.113.50
Source Port: 52341
Destination Port: 443
Protocol: TCP
Start Time: 10:15:32.123
End Time: 10:16:45.789
Packets: 1247
Bytes: 945,832
```

### 3.3 NetFlow vs. IPFIX

**NetFlow**
- Developed by Cisco Systems
- Multiple versions (v5, v7, v9)
- v5 most widely deployed (but limited)
- v9 introduced templates for extensibility

**IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export)**
- IETF standardization of NetFlow v9 (RFC 7011)
- More flexible template system
- Support for variable-length fields
- Becoming the modern standard

**Connection to Main Topic:** Both NetFlow and IPFIX serve the same fundamental purpose - they're just different standards for encoding flow metadata. Understanding this helps investigators work with different network equipment vendors.

### 3.4 How Flow Data Collection Works

```
[Router/Switch] → [Flow Exporter] → [Flow Collector] → [Analysis Tools]
       ↓
[Sampling (Optional)]
```

The collection process:
1. Network device observes packets
2. Packets are classified into flows based on 7-tuple
3. Flow statistics are accumulated
4. Flow records are exported periodically or when flows expire
5. Collector stores flow data in databases
6. Analysis tools query and visualize flow data

**Flow Expiration Triggers:**
- TCP connection termination (FIN/RST)
- Idle timeout (typically 15 seconds)
- Active timeout (typically 30 minutes)
- Cache is full

### 3.5 Advantages of Flow Data

**Scalability**
- Dramatically reduced storage requirements (100:1 to 1000:1 reduction vs. FPC)
- Lower processing overhead on network devices
- Enables long-term retention (months or years)

**High-Level Visibility**
- Excellent for baseline network behavior
- Identifies communication patterns and anomalies
- Enables network forensics at scale

**Privacy Preservation**
- No payload capture reduces privacy concerns
- More acceptable for compliance requirements
- Easier to share across organizational boundaries

**Operational Efficiency**
- Widely supported in network infrastructure
- Integrates with SIEM and monitoring platforms
- Real-time alerting capabilities

### 3.6 Disadvantages and Limitations of Flow Data

**Limited Forensic Detail**
- No payload content means no deep protocol analysis
- Cannot reconstruct application-layer transactions
- No file extraction or malware capture
- Cannot determine what data was exfiltrated (only that data transfer occurred)

**Sampling Introduces Gaps**
- Many implementations use 1:100 or 1:1000 sampling
- Can miss short-lived or low-volume connections
- Statistical accuracy vs. complete accuracy trade-off

**Delayed Detection**
- Flow records exported periodically (not real-time packets)
- May miss rapid attack sequences
- Less useful for immediate threat hunting

**Connection to Main Topic:** Flow data trades forensic depth for operational efficiency. This makes it complementary to, not a replacement for, FPC in comprehensive security architectures.

## Module 6: Practical Considerations for Implementation

### 6.1 Legal and Compliance Requirements

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- **Wiretap laws:** Vary by jurisdiction; some require consent for full packet capture
- **Data protection regulations:** GDPR, CCPA may restrict payload capture
- **Industry standards:** PCI-DSS, HIPAA influence collection scope
- **Evidence admissibility:** Chain of custody requirements

**Best Practices:**
- Document collection policies clearly
- Implement role-based access controls
- Maintain audit logs of data access
- Encrypt stored packet captures and flow data

### 6.2 Architectural Planning

**Capacity Planning for FPC:**
- Calculate expected traffic volume: `(Link Speed × Utilization) ÷ 8 = Bytes per second`
- Storage needed: `Bytes per second × 86,400 × Retention days`
- Plan for 30-50% overhead for indexing and metadata

**Capacity Planning for Flow Data:**
- Typical flow record: 50-100 bytes
- Flows per second varies (high for web traffic, lower for persistent connections)
- Storage: Often 1-2% of equivalent FPC storage

**Network Design Considerations:**
- **Tap vs. SPAN:** Physical taps preferred for FPC (no packet loss); SPAN ports acceptable for flow export
- **Out-of-band vs. inline:** FPC sensors typically out-of-band; flow collection always out-of-band
- **High-availability:** Redundant collectors and storage

### 6.3 Operational Maintenance

**FPC Maintenance:**

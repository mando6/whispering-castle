## Module 1: Introduction to Virtual Network Forensics

### 1.1 What is Virtual Network Analysis?

Virtual Network Analysis in digital forensics refers to the systematic examination of network communications, configurations, and artifacts within virtualized environments. Unlike traditional network forensics that examines physical network infrastructure, virtual network forensics deals with software-defined networks, virtual switches, and the unique challenges posed by virtualization platforms.

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Virtual network analysis is a critical subset of digital forensics because modern enterprise environments increasingly rely on virtualized infrastructure. Investigators must understand how network traffic flows through virtual layers to reconstruct events, identify security incidents, and gather evidence that meets legal standards.

### 1.2 Why Virtual Networks Are Different

Virtual networks introduce additional complexity layers:

- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):** Traffic routing occurs in software rather than hardware
- **Multiple Network Layers:** Physical, virtual switch, and guest OS network stacks
- **Snapshot Capabilities:** Network states can be captured at specific points in time
- **Migration Challenges:** VMs can move between hosts, complicating evidence trails
- **Volatile Evidence:** Virtual network configurations exist in memory and can disappear

**Connection to Main Topic:** Understanding these differences is fundamental because traditional network forensic techniques may not capture evidence in virtualized environments. The ephemeral nature of virtual networks requires specialized approaches to ensure evidence preservation.

### 1.3 Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before performing any forensic analysis:

- **Authorization:** Ensure proper legal authority (warrants, corporate policies)
- **Chain of Custody:** Document all actions taken during investigation
- **Data Privacy:** Be aware of regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Non-Destructive Methods:** Preserve original evidence whenever possible

## Module 2: Virtualization Architecture Fundamentals

### 2.1 Hypervisor Types and Network Implications

**Type 1 Hypervisors (Bare Metal):**
- VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen
- Direct hardware access provides better network performance
- Network traffic may bypass traditional monitoring points

**Type 2 Hypervisors (Hosted):**
- VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox
- Run atop host operating systems
- Network traffic typically traverses host OS network stack

**Forensic Significance:** The hypervisor type determines where network evidence resides and how it can be accessed. Type 1 hypervisors may require specialized tools to access network configurations and logs.

### 2.2 Virtual Network Components

**Virtual Switches (vSwitch):**
- Software switches that connect VMs to each other and external networks
- Maintain MAC address tables, VLAN configurations, and port groups
- Store configuration data that reveals network topology

**Virtual Network Adapters:**
- Emulated network interface cards presented to guest VMs
- Can be bridged, NAT, or host-only configurations
- MAC addresses may be generated or manually assigned

**Virtual Firewalls and Routers:**
- Software-based security appliances within virtual environment
- Contain logs, rules, and connection states

**Connection to Main Topic:** Each component generates artifacts that forensic investigators must identify, preserve, and analyze to reconstruct network activity within virtual environments.

### 2.3 Network Modes in Virtualization

**Bridged Mode:**
- VM appears as physical device on network
- Direct access to external network
- Evidence may exist on physical network infrastructure

**NAT Mode:**
- Hypervisor performs address translation
- NAT logs critical for tracking external communications
- Internal VM IP addresses hidden from external network

**Host-Only Mode:**
- Isolated network between VMs and host
- Evidence confined to host system
- Useful for analyzing malware in isolated environment

**Internal Mode:**
- VMs communicate only with each other
- No host or external connectivity
- Requires examination of VM-to-VM traffic

## Module 5: Network Traffic Analysis in Virtual Environments

### 5.1 Capturing Virtual Network Traffic

**In-Guest Capture:**
- Install packet capture tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) within VMs
- Captures only traffic visible to that specific VM
- May miss internal hypervisor communications

**Virtual Switch Port Mirroring:**

VMware example:
```bash
# Enable port mirroring on vSwitch
vim-cmd hostsvc/net/vswitch_setpolicy --mirror-dst=vmnic1 vSwitch0
```

Hyper-V example:
```powershell
# Set port mirroring
Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName "MonitorVM" | 
  Set-VMNetworkAdapter -PortMirroring Destination

Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName "TargetVM" | 
  Set-VMNetworkAdapter -PortMirroring Source
```

**Hypervisor-Level Capture:**
- Capture at vSwitch level to see all VM traffic
- Use tools like pktcap-uw (VMware) or Message Analyzer (Windows)
- Provides complete visibility of virtual network

**Connection to Main Topic:** Effective traffic capture is essential for network forensics because it provides the raw data needed to reconstruct communications, identify malicious activity, and establish timelines.

### 5.2 Analyzing Packet Captures

**Basic Analysis with Wireshark:**

Key filters for virtual environment investigations:
```
# Find all traffic for specific VM IP
ip.addr == 192.168.1.100

# Identify data exfiltration (large uploads)
tcp.len > 1000 and ip.src == 192.168.1.100

# Find suspicious protocols
dns or ftp or telnet

# Identify beaconing behavior
(http.request or ssl.handshake.type == 1) and 
  frame.time_delta > 60 and frame.time_delta < 65
```

**Timeline Reconstruction:**
- Correlate packet timestamps with VM logs
- Identify communication patterns between VMs
- Map external connections to specific VMs

**Artifact Extraction:**
- Recover files transferred over network (Export Objects)
- Extract credentials from unencrypted protocols
- Identify Command & Control (C2) communications

### 5.3 Virtual Network Flow Analysis

**Flow Data Collection:**

VMware supports NetFlow/IPFIX:
```bash
# Enable NetFlow on distributed switch
esxcli network vswitch dvs vmware netflow set \
  --collector-ip=192.168.1.50 \
  --collector-port=2055
```

**Flow Analysis Benefits:**
- Lower storage requirements than full packet capture

## Module 6: Memory Forensics in Virtual Networks

### 6.1 Why Memory Matters for Network Forensics

Virtual machine memory contains ephemeral network data:
- Active network connections
- Cached DNS queries
- Network credentials in memory
- Malware with network capabilities
- Encryption keys for network traffic

**Connection to Main Topic:** Memory forensics bridges the gap between static configuration analysis and dynamic network activity, revealing what was actually happening at a specific moment in time.

### 6.2 Acquiring VM Memory

**VMware Memory Acquisition:**
```bash
# Suspend VM to create .vmem file
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.suspend <vmid>

# Or use snapshot with memory
vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.create <vmid> "Forensic" "Investigation" 1 1
```

**Hyper-V Memory Acquisition:**
```powershell
# Save VM state (creates .bin and .vsv files)
Save-VM -Name "TargetVM"

# Or export with saved state
Export-VM -Name "TargetVM" -Path "E:\Forensics" -CaptureLiveState CaptureSavedState
```

**Live Memory Acquisition:**
- Use tools like WinPmem (Windows) or LiME (Linux) inside guest
- Acquire without disrupting VM operation
- Captures most current state but may miss some artifacts

### 6.3 Analyzing Memory for Network Artifacts

**Using Volatility Framework:**

```bash
# Identify VM profile
volatility -f memory.vmem imageinfo

# List network connections
volatility -f memory.vmem --profile=Win10x64 netscan

# Extract processes with network activity
volatility -f memory.vmem --profile=Win10x64 netscan | grep ESTABLISHED

# Find hidden network activity
volatility -f memory.vmem --profile=Win10x64 connections
volatility -f memory.vmem --profile=Win10x64 connscan

# Extract network-related registry keys
volatility -f memory.vmem --profile=Win10x64 printkey \
  -K "Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList"
```

**Network Artifact Recovery:**
- Active TCP/UDP connections with PIDs

## Module 1: Foundations of Protocol Analysis

### 1.1 What is Protocol Analysis?

Protocol analysis in digital forensics is the systematic examination of network communication data to understand what occurred during a specific timeframe. It involves capturing, dissecting, and interpreting network packets to reconstruct events, identify security incidents, gather evidence, and understand user behavior.

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Protocol analysis serves as a critical pillar of network forensics, enabling investigators to answer key questions: Who communicated with whom? What data was transmitted? When did communication occur? Were there any policy violations or security breaches?

### 1.2 The OSI and TCP/IP Models

Understanding protocol layering is essential for effective analysis:

**OSI Model Layers (Top to Bottom):**
1. **Application Layer** - User-facing protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS)
2. **Presentation Layer** - Data formatting and encryption
3. **Session Layer** - Connection management
4. **Transport Layer** - End-to-end communication (TCP, UDP)
5. **Network Layer** - Routing and addressing (IP, ICMP)
6. **Data Link Layer** - Local network communication (Ethernet, WiFi)
7. **Physical Layer** - Hardware transmission

**TCP/IP Model (Simplified):**
- Application Layer (combines OSI layers 5-7)
- Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
- Internet Layer (IP)
- Network Access Layer (combines OSI layers 1-2)

**Forensic Relevance:** Each layer provides different types of evidence. Application-layer analysis reveals user actions and content, while lower layers provide routing information, timing data, and network topology details.

### 1.3 Common Network Protocols in Forensic Investigations

| Protocol | Layer | Purpose | Forensic Value |
|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS | Application | Web traffic | User browsing, file downloads, web-based attacks |
| SMTP/POP3/IMAP | Application | Email | Email content, attachments, communication patterns |
| FTP/SFTP | Application | File transfer | Data exfiltration, file access patterns |
| DNS | Application | Name resolution | Domain lookups, C&C communication, data exfiltration |
| TCP | Transport | Reliable delivery | Connection establishment, data streams |
| UDP | Transport | Fast delivery | VoIP, DNS, streaming, some malware |
| IP | Network | Addressing/routing | Source/destination tracking, geolocation |

## Module 2: Packet Capture Fundamentals

### 2.1 Understanding Network Packets

A network packet is a formatted unit of data that contains:
- **Headers:** Metadata including source/destination addresses, protocol information, flags
- **Payload:** The actual data being transmitted
- **Trailer:** Error-checking information (in some protocols)

**Forensic Consideration:** Headers provide context and routing information, while payloads contain the evidentiary content. Both are critical for comprehensive analysis.

### 2.2 Packet Capture Methods

**Promiscuous Mode Capture:**
- Network interface captures all packets on the network segment
- Requires proper positioning (near target, hub, or SPAN port)
- Legal considerations: Ensure proper authorization

**TAP (Test Access Point):**
- Physical device inserted into network path
- Passive monitoring with no network impact
- Preferred for high-security environments

**SPAN/Mirror Ports:**
- Switch configuration that copies traffic to monitoring port
- Common in enterprise environments
- May miss packets during high traffic

**Connection to Protocol Analysis:** The capture method affects what traffic you can analyze. Understanding these methods helps you assess the completeness and reliability of your evidence.

### 2.3 Capture Tools and Formats

**Primary Tools:**

**Wireshark** - Industry-standard GUI packet analyzer
- Cross-platform, extensive protocol support
- Powerful filtering and display capabilities
- Built-in protocol decoders

**tcpdump** - Command-line packet capture
- Lightweight, scriptable
- Ideal for remote or headless systems
- Unix/Linux focused

**tshark** - Wireshark's CLI counterpart
- Same protocol support as Wireshark
- Excellent for automation and batch processing

**File Formats:**
- **PCAP (Packet Capture):** Standard format, widely supported
- **PCAPNG (PCAP Next Generation):** Enhanced format with metadata support
- **Forensic Relevance:** PCAPNG preserves more context (capture time, interface details, comments)

### 2.4 Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before capturing network traffic:
- **Authorization:** Obtain proper legal authority (warrant, consent, or corporate policy)
- **Scope:** Capture only what's necessary for the investigation
- **Privacy:** Be aware of personally identifiable information (PII) and privileged communications
- **Chain of Custody:** Document capture parameters, timing, and storage
- **Wiretap Laws:** Understand federal and state regulations

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** Protocol analysis evidence must be legally obtained and properly documented to be admissible in court or disciplinary proceedings.

## Module 3: Analyzing Captured Traffic

### 3.1 Initial Packet Inspection

When you first open a packet capture, perform these steps:

**1. Capture Overview:**
```
Statistics → Capture File Properties
```
- Capture duration and timeframe
- Number of packets
- Average packet rate
- Interfaces involved

**2. Protocol Hierarchy:**
```
Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy
```
- Distribution of protocols
- Identify dominant traffic types
- Spot unusual protocols

**3. Endpoints Analysis:**
```
Statistics → Endpoints
```
- Most active hosts
- IPv4/IPv6 addresses involved
- Geographic considerations

**Connection to Investigation:** This high-level view helps you understand the scope of captured traffic and identify areas requiring detailed analysis.

### 3.2 Display Filters vs. Capture Filters

**Capture Filters (BPF Syntax):**
- Applied during capture
- Reduces capture file size
- Cannot be removed from existing captures
- Example: `host 192.168.1.100 and port 80`

**Display Filters (Wireshark Syntax):**
- Applied to existing captures
- Non-destructive, reversible
- More powerful and flexible
- Example: `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100 && tcp.port == 80`

**Common Display Filters for Forensics:**
```
http.request                    # All HTTP requests
smtp.data.fragment              # Email content
ftp.request.command == "RETR"   # FTP downloads
dns.qry.name contains "evil"    # DNS queries containing term
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # TCP SYN packets (connection attempts)
ip.addr == 10.0.0.5             # All traffic to/from specific IP
```

### 3.3 Following Streams

**TCP Stream Reconstruction:**

The "Follow TCP Stream" feature reconstructs entire conversations:

```
Right-click packet → Follow → TCP Stream
```

**What it shows:**
- Complete bidirectional conversation
- Client data (typically red/blue)
- Server data (typically blue/red)
- Timestamps preserved in original capture

**Forensic Applications:**
- Reconstruct HTTP sessions
- View complete email messages
- Analyze file transfers
- Detect data exfiltration

**UDP Stream Reconstruction:**

Similar process for UDP-based protocols:
```
Right-click packet → Follow → UDP Stream
```

**Use cases:**
- DNS queries and responses
- VoIP conversations (with additional processing)
- Gaming traffic
- Streaming protocols

**Connection to Protocol Analysis:** Stream reconstruction transforms fragmented packets into human-readable conversations, making it possible to understand what actually transpired during network communication.

## Module 4: HTTP/HTTPS Analysis

### 4.1 HTTP Protocol Structure

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol:

**HTTP Request Components:**
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml
Cookie: session=abc123
```

- **Method:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **URI:** Resource path
- **Headers:** Metadata about request
- **Body:** Data sent with POST/PUT requests

**HTTP Response Components:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234
Set-Cookie: session=xyz789

<html>...</html>
```

- **Status Code:** 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.
- **Headers:** Metadata about response
- **Body:** Requested content

### 4.2 Analyzing HTTP Traffic in Wireshark

**Viewing HTTP Requests:**
```
Filter: http.request
```

**Key Fields to Examine:**
- `http.request.method` - Action being performed
- `http.request.uri` - Resource requested
- `http.host` - Target server
- `http.user_agent` - Client software
- `http.cookie` - Session/authentication tokens
- `http.referer` - Previous page (typo is intentional in HTTP spec)

**Viewing HTTP Responses:**
```
Filter: http.response
```

**Key Fields:**
- `http.response.code` - Success/failure indicator
- `http.content_type` - Type of data returned
- `http.content_length` - Size of response
- `http.server` - Server software version

### 4.3 Extracting HTTP Objects

Wireshark can export files transferred via HTTP:

```
File → Export Objects → HTTP
```

**Forensic Applications:**
- Recover downloaded files
- Extract uploaded documents
- Capture images/videos accessed
- Identify malware downloads

**Important:** Document the extraction process, including packet numbers and timestamps, for chain of custody.

### 4.4 Analyzing POST Requests

POST requests often contain sensitive data:

**Login Credentials:**
```
Filter: http.request.method == "POST" && http.request.uri contains "login"
```

Look in the packet payload for:
- Username/password fields
- Authentication tokens
- Form data

**Form Submissions:**
```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=john&password=secret123&submit=Login
```

**Forensic Significance:** POST data may reveal:
- Account compromise attempts
- Data entry and submission
- User actions on web applications
- Exfiltrated information

### 4.5 HTTPS and Encrypted Traffic

**Challenge:** HTTPS encrypts application-layer data using TLS/SSL.

**What You Can Still Analyze:**
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Timing and duration of connections
- Amount of data transferred
- Server Name Indication (SNI) - domain name in TLS handshake
- Certificate information

**Decryption Methods (with proper authorization):**

1. **SSL/TLS Key Log File:**
   - Browser can log session keys
   - Load into Wireshark: Edit → Preferences → Protocols → TLS → (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename

2. **Private Key Decryption:**
   - Requires server's private key
   - Only works with certain cipher suites (not Perfect Forward Secrecy)

3. **Man-in-the-Middle Proxy:**
   - Deploy legitimate MITM proxy (e.g., mitmproxy, Burp Suite)
   - Requires network control and endpoint trust

**Legal Warning:** Decrypting HTTPS requires explicit authorization and may have legal implications depending on jurisdiction.

**Connection to Protocol Analysis:** Understanding what can and cannot be observed in encrypted traffic is crucial for setting realistic investigative expectations and pursuing alternative evidence sources.

## Module 5: Email Protocol Analysis

### 5.1 SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

SMTP is used for sending email between mail servers and from clients to servers.

**SMTP Command Sequence:**
```
HELO/EHLO mail.sender.com          # Identify sender
MAIL FROM:<sender@example.com>     # Envelope sender
RCPT TO:<recipient@example.com>    # Envelope recipient
DATA                                # Begin message content
Subject: Test Message
From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com

This is the message body.
.                                   # End of message (single period)
QUIT                                # Close connection
```

**Analyzing SMTP in Wireshark:**
```
Filter: smtp
```

**Key Forensic Elements:**
- **Sender/Recipient:** Email addresses involved
- **Message Content:** Complete email body
- **Attachments:** MIME-encoded files
- **Timestamps:** When email was transmitted
- **Routing Information:** Email path through servers

### 5.2 POP3 and IMAP (Email Retrieval)

**POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3):**
- Downloads email from server to client
- Typically deletes from server (configurable)
- Simpler protocol, easier to analyze

**Common POP3 Commands:**
```
USER username        # Authenticate user
PASS password       # Provide password (plaintext!)
LIST                # List messages
RETR 1              # Retrieve message 1
DELE 1              # Mark for deletion
QUIT                # Apply changes and disconnect
```

**Wireshark Filter:**
```
Filter: pop
```

**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):**
- Synchronizes email between server and client
- More complex, supports folders and flags
- Email typically remains on server

**Forensic Considerations:**
- POP3 is easier to analyze but captures less context
- IMAP shows more user interaction (folder access, searches)
- Both may transmit passwords in cleartext unless using SSL/TLS

### 5.3 Extracting Email Content

**Following Email Streams:**
1. Filter for SMTP, POP3, or IMAP traffic
2. Right-click packet → Follow → TCP Stream
3. View complete email message

**MIME Decoding:**

Email attachments use MIME encoding (Base64):
```
Content-Type: application/pdf; name="document.pdf"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

JVBERi0xLjQKJeLjz9MKMSAwIG9iago8PC9UeXBlL0NhdGFsb2cvUGFnZXMgMiAw...
```

**Decoding Process:**
1. Extract Base64 string
2. Decode using tools (Python, CyberChef, online decoders)
3. Save as original file type

**Example Python Script:**
```python
import base64

with open('encoded.txt', 'r') as f:
    encoded = f.read()

decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded)

with open('attachment.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(decoded)
```

### 5.4 Email Header Analysis

Email headers contain valuable metadata:

**Key Headers:**
- `Received:` - Routing path (read bottom-to-top)
- `From:` - Purported sender (can be spoofed)
- `To:`, `Cc:`, `Bcc:` - Recipients
- `Date:` - When email was composed
- `Message-ID:` - Unique identifier
- `X-Originating-IP:` - Sender's IP (some providers)
- `Authentication-Results:` - SPF, DKIM, DMARC results

**Forensic Applications:**
- Trace email origin
- Identify spoofed senders
- Determine transmission timeline
- Verify email authenticity

**Connection to Protocol Analysis:** Email protocols provide rich forensic data including message content, attachment recovery, sender verification, and communication patterns—all critical for investigations involving harassment, data leakage, or fraud.

## Module 6: Other Application-Layer Protocols

### 6.1 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP uses two connections:
- **Control Channel (Port 21):** Commands and responses
- **Data Channel (Port 20 or ephemeral):** File transfers

**Common FTP Commands:**
```
USER username       # Login username
PASS password      # Login password (cleartext!)
LIST               # Directory listing
CWD /directory     # Change directory
RETR filename      # Download file
STOR filename      # Upload file
QUIT               # Disconnect
```

**Analyzing FTP:**
```
Filter: ftp
```

**Following FTP Sessions:**
1. Filter for FTP traffic
2. Identify USER and PASS commands (credentials)
3. Track RETR/STOR commands (file transfers)
4. Follow FTP-DATA streams to extract files

**Forensic Value:**
- User authentication (username/password)
- Directory browsing patterns
- Files uploaded/downloaded
- Timing of file transfers
- Source/destination of data

### 6.2 DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.

**DNS Query Types:**
- **A Record:** IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record:** IPv6 address
- **MX Record:** Mail server
- **TXT Record:** Text data (often used for verification)
- **PTR Record:** Reverse lookup (IP to name)
- **CNAME Record:** Canonical name (alias)

**Analyzing DNS:**
```
Filter: dns
```

**Useful Filters:**
```
dns.qry.name contains "example.com"    # Queries for specific domain
dns.flags.response == 0                # Queries only
dns.flags.response == 1                # Responses only
dns.qry.type == 1                      # A record queries
```

**Forensic Applications:**

1. **Command and Control (C&C) Detection:**
   - Unusual domains
   - High-frequency queries
   - DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) patterns

2. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - DNS tunneling
   - Large TXT records
   - Unusual query patterns

3. **Malware Analysis:**
   - Domains contacted by malware
   - Time-based analysis of infections

4. **User Activity:**
   - Websites visited (before HTTP)
   - Application behavior

**Connection to Investigation:** DNS queries often precede other network activity, providing early indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration attempts, or user intentions.

### 6.3 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

DHCP assigns IP addresses dynamically to network clients.

**DHCP Process (DORA):**
1. **Discover:** Client broadcasts request
2. **Offer:** Server offers IP address
3. **Request:** Client requests offered address
4. **Acknowledge:** Server confirms assignment

**Analyzing DHCP:**
```
Filter: dhcp or bootp
```

**Forensic Value:**
- **MAC-to-IP Correlation:** Links hardware address to IP
- **Hostname Information:** Client computer names
- **Lease Timing:** When devices joined network
- **Network Configuration:** DNS servers, gateways, subnets

**Practical Application:** When you have an IP address from logs but need to identify the physical device, DHCP traffic can provide the MAC address correlation.

### 6.4 Telnet and SSH

**Telnet (Port 23):**
- Unencrypted remote terminal access
- Transmits credentials and commands in cleartext
- Rarely used today due to security concerns

**Analysis:**
```
Filter: telnet
```

Telnet streams can be followed to view entire sessions, including passwords and commands.

**SSH (Port 22):**
- Encrypted remote access
- Successor to Telnet
- Cannot decrypt without keys

**Analysis:**
```
Filter: ssh
```

**What You Can Determine:**
- Connection establishment and timing
- Amount of data transferred
- Session duration
- Source/destination hosts
- SSH version and algorithms (from handshake)

**Forensic Note:** While SSH content is encrypted, metadata analysis can reveal patterns of administrative access, potential unauthorized connections, and timing of system administration activities.

## Module 1: Introduction to Detection Methods in Digital Forensics

### 1.1 The Foundation of Detection

Digital forensics relies heavily on the ability to identify malicious or unauthorized activity within systems and networks. Two fundamental approaches dominate this field:

1. **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifying known patterns of malicious behavior
2. **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Recognizing deviations from established normal behavior

**Connection to Digital Forensics**: These detection methods serve as the investigator's primary tools for identifying security incidents, understanding attack vectors, and reconstructing timelines of malicious activity. They form the cornerstone of proactive threat hunting and reactive incident response.

### 1.2 Why Both Methods Matter

Neither approach is perfect in isolation:
- Signature detection excels at identifying known threats with high accuracy
- Anomaly detection can identify novel or zero-day attacks
- Combined approaches provide comprehensive coverage

## Module 2: Signature-Based Detection

### 2.1 What Are Signatures?

A **signature** is a unique pattern or characteristic that identifies a specific threat, malware variant, or attack technique. Think of it as a digital fingerprint.

**Types of Signatures:**

1. **Hash Signatures**: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 checksums of known malicious files
2. **Pattern Signatures**: Specific byte sequences or strings in files or network traffic
3. **Behavioral Signatures**: Sequences of actions that indicate malicious intent
4. **Network Signatures**: Patterns in packet headers, payloads, or communication flows

### 2.2 How Signature Detection Works

```
Process Flow:
1. Collect data (files, network traffic, logs)
2. Extract relevant features
3. Compare against signature database
4. Flag matches as potential threats
5. Generate alerts for investigation
```

**Connection to Main Topic**: Signature detection provides the rapid identification capability essential for forensic investigations. When analyzing a compromised system, signatures help investigators quickly determine which known malware families or attack tools were used.

### 2.3 Practical Application: Malware Detection

**Example Scenario**: Detecting a known ransomware variant

```
Signature indicators:
- File hash: a3f8d9e21c456... (matches WannaCry)
- Network traffic: Connection to kill-switch domain
- Registry modification: Creates key at HKLM\SOFTWARE\WanaCrypt0r
- File extension changes: .WNCRY appended to encrypted files
```

### 2.4 Network Signature Detection: Port Scanning

Port scans have characteristic patterns that can be detected through signatures:

**SYN Scan Signature:**
- Multiple TCP SYN packets to sequential ports
- No completed three-way handshakes
- Short time interval between attempts
- Source: single IP address

**Detection Rule Example (Snort-style):**
```
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Potential Port Scan"; 
flags:S; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 20, seconds 60;)
```

### 2.5 Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- High accuracy for known threats
- Low false positive rates
- Fast processing and detection
- Easy to understand and document

**Limitations:**
- Cannot detect unknown/novel threats
- Vulnerable to signature evasion techniques
- Requires constant database updates
- Ineffective against polymorphic malware

## Module 3: Anomaly-Based Detection

### 3.1 Understanding Anomalies

An **anomaly** is a deviation from established normal behavior or baseline patterns. Instead of looking for what you know is bad, you identify what doesn't look normal.

**Key Concept**: "Normal" must be defined through baseline profiling of systems, networks, and user behaviors during non-malicious periods.

**Connection to Main Topic**: Anomaly detection is crucial in forensic investigations because attackers constantly evolve their techniques. When signatures fail, anomalies can reveal sophisticated attacks, insider threats, and zero-day exploits.

### 3.2 Types of Anomalies

1. **Point Anomalies**: Single data points that deviate significantly
   - Example: A user account accessing 1000 files at 3 AM

2. **Contextual Anomalies**: Behavior that's abnormal in specific contexts
   - Example: Large data uploads during business hours might be normal, but suspicious at midnight

3. **Collective Anomalies**: Patterns that are anomalous as a group
   - Example: Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login

### 3.3 Building Baselines

Effective anomaly detection requires establishing baseline behavior:

**Network Baseline Components:**
- Typical bandwidth usage patterns
- Standard protocols and ports in use
- Normal geographic locations for connections
- Usual data transfer volumes
- Expected device communication patterns

**System Baseline Components:**
- Standard process execution patterns
- Normal CPU and memory utilization
- Typical file access patterns
- Regular user login times and locations
- Expected application behavior

### 3.4 Statistical Methods for Anomaly Detection

**Common Techniques:**

1. **Standard Deviation Analysis**
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation of baseline
   - Flag data points beyond 2-3 standard deviations

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**
   - Identify outliers beyond Q1 - 1.5×IQR or Q3 + 1.5×IQR

3. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Detect unusual patterns over time
   - Identify sudden spikes or drops

### 3.5 Practical Application: Detecting Malware Communication

**Normal Behavior:**
- Workstation: Regular DNS queries to corporate domains
- Outbound connections: Standard HTTPS to approved cloud services
- Data transfer: 100-500 MB per day during business hours

**Anomalous Behavior Indicating C2 Communication:**
- DNS queries: Unusual TLDs (.tk, .cc), algorithmically generated domains
- Outbound connections: New external IPs, non-standard ports (8443, 8080)
- Data transfer: 2 GB uploaded at 2 AM
- Beacon pattern: Regular connections every 60 seconds

**Detection Approach:**
```
Baseline metrics (30-day average):
- DNS queries/hour: 15 ± 5
- Unique external IPs: 25 ± 8
- Data transferred: 300 MB ± 150 MB

Alert triggers:
- DNS queries > 30/hour
- New external IPs > 40
- Data transfer > 600 MB outside business hours
- Regular connections at fixed intervals (beaconing)
```

### 3.6 Detecting Unauthorized Port Scans Through Anomalies

**Normal Network Behavior:**
- Established connections to known servers
- Typical service ports (80, 443, 22, 3389)
- Connection duration: minutes to hours

**Anomalous Scanning Behavior:**
- Connections attempted to 100+ sequential ports in minutes
- High number of connection failures
- Very short connection durations (milliseconds)
- Unusual source behavior: single host contacting multiple targets

**Anomaly Indicators:**
```
Scan Detection Metrics:
- Connection attempts per minute: baseline 5-10, anomaly >50
- Failed connection ratio: baseline <10%, anomaly >80%
- Unique destination ports: baseline 3-5, anomaly >20
- Average connection duration: baseline >10 seconds, anomaly <1 second
```

### 3.7 Machine Learning in Anomaly Detection

Modern anomaly detection increasingly leverages machine learning:

**Supervised Learning:**
- Trained on labeled datasets (normal vs. malicious)
- Classification algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Clustering algorithms: K-means, DBSCAN
- No prior labeling required
- Identifies patterns and outliers automatically

**Connection to Digital Forensics**: ML-based anomaly detection can process massive datasets quickly, identifying subtle patterns that human analysts might miss. This is particularly valuable when analyzing enterprise-scale network traffic or log files.

### 3.8 Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Detects unknown and zero-day attacks
- Adapts to evolving threats
- Identifies insider threats and subtle compromises
- No signature database required

**Limitations:**
- Higher false positive rates
- Requires accurate baseline establishment
- Can be evaded through slow, gradual changes
- May miss attacks that mimic normal behavior
- Computationally intensive

## Module 4: Hybrid Approaches and Integration

### 4.1 Combining Both Methods

Most effective forensic practices employ both signature and anomaly detection:

**Layered Defense Strategy:**
```
Layer 1: Signature Detection (Fast, High Confidence)
    ↓ (Unknown threats pass through)
Layer 2: Anomaly Detection (Catches novel threats)
    ↓ (Generates alerts)
Layer 3: Human Analysis (Validates and responds)
```

**Connection to Main Topic**: In real-world digital forensics, investigators rarely rely on a single method. A comprehensive investigation correlates signature matches with behavioral anomalies to build a complete picture of an incident.

### 4.2 Case Study: APT Detection

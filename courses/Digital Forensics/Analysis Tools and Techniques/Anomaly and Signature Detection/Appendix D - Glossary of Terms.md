**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**: Prolonged and targeted cyberattack where an attacker gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

**Baseline**: A reference point of normal system or network behavior used for comparison to identify anomalies.

**Beaconing**: Regular, periodic communication between compromised systems and command-and-control servers.

**Command and Control (C2/C&C)**: Infrastructure used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised systems.

**False Negative**: Failure to detect actual malicious activity.

**False Positive**: Incorrectly identifying benign activity as malicious.

**Hash**: Cryptographic fingerprint of a file (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).

**Indicator of Compromise (IOC)**: Artifact or observable that suggests a security breach.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious actions.

**Lateral Movement**: Techniques attackers use to progressively move through a network.

**Living Off the Land (LOTL)**: Attack technique using legitimate system tools to avoid detection.

**Polymorphic Malware**: Malware that changes its code signature while maintaining core functionality.

**Port Scan**: Technique to discover open ports and services on a target system.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Platform that aggregates and analyzes security data from multiple sources.

**Signature**: Known pattern or characteristic that identifies specific threats.

**Threshold**: Predefined limit that triggers an alert when exceeded.

**Zero-Day**: Previously unknown vulnerability exploited before a patch is available.

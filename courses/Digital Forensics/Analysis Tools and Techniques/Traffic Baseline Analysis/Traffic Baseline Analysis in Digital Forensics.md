## Module 1: Introduction to Traffic Baseline Analysis

### What is Traffic Baseline Analysis?

Traffic baseline analysis is the systematic process of documenting, measuring, and understanding normal network behavior patterns within an environment. This baseline serves as a reference point that enables forensic analysts and security professionals to identify deviations that may indicate malicious activity, policy violations, or system compromises.

**Connection to Digital Forensics:** In digital forensic investigations, establishing what is "normal" is critical. Without understanding baseline behavior, analysts cannot effectively distinguish between legitimate user activity and potential security incidents. Traffic baselines provide the context necessary for evidence interpretation and incident reconstruction.

### Why Baselines Matter

1. **Anomaly Detection:** Unusual patterns become visible only when compared against known-normal behavior
2. **Incident Response:** Baselines accelerate the identification of compromised systems
3. **Forensic Evidence:** Documented baselines strengthen investigative findings and legal proceedings
4. **Resource Planning:** Understanding normal traffic helps optimize network infrastructure
5. **Threat Hunting:** Proactive security teams use baselines to discover hidden threats

### Key Principles

- **Contextual Awareness:** Baselines must reflect the specific environment (corporate, academic, industrial)
- **Temporal Considerations:** Network behavior varies by time of day, week, and season
- **Continuous Evolution:** Baselines require regular updates as legitimate business operations change
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis:** Effective baselines capture volume, protocol distribution, endpoints, and behavioral patterns

## Module 2: Components of Network Traffic Baselines

### 2.1 Traffic Volume Metrics

**Connection to Main Topic:** Volume analysis forms the foundation of baseline establishment by quantifying normal network load patterns.

#### Key Measurements

- **Bandwidth Utilization:** Average, peak, and off-peak usage rates
- **Packet Rates:** Packets per second (PPS) across different time periods
- **Connection Rates:** New connections established per unit time
- **Data Transfer Volumes:** Inbound vs. outbound traffic ratios

#### What to Document

- Daily traffic patterns (business hours vs. off-hours)
- Weekly variations (weekday vs. weekend activity)
- Seasonal changes (fiscal periods, holiday seasons)
- Growth trends over months and years

### 2.2 Protocol Distribution

**Connection to Main Topic:** Understanding normal protocol usage helps identify protocol abuse and tunneling techniques used by attackers.

#### Core Protocols to Baseline

- **Application Layer:** HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, FTP, SSH
- **Transport Layer:** TCP vs. UDP ratios
- **Network Layer:** ICMP usage patterns
- **Specialized Protocols:** RDP, SMB, database protocols specific to your environment

#### Analysis Considerations

- Expected protocol ratios (e.g., 70% HTTPS, 15% DNS, 10% other)
- Protocol usage by time of day
- Unusual protocol combinations
- Encrypted vs. unencrypted traffic ratios

### 2.3 Endpoint Communication Patterns

**Connection to Main Topic:** Mapping normal communication relationships enables detection of lateral movement, command-and-control channels, and data exfiltration.

#### Internal Communications

- Server-to-server interactions
- Workstation-to-workstation traffic (should be minimal in many environments)
- Network segmentation compliance

#### External Communications

- Approved cloud services and SaaS applications
- Partner/vendor connections
- Geographic distribution of external connections
- Common external IP ranges and ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers)

### 2.4 Temporal Behavioral Patterns

**Connection to Main Topic:** Time-based analysis reveals activity that occurs outside normal business operations, a common indicator of compromise.

#### Time-Based Metrics

- User authentication patterns (login times, frequency)
- File access patterns
- Email traffic flows
- Backup and maintenance windows

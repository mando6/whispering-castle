**Beaconing:** Regular, periodic network communications used by malware to check in with command and control servers

**Chain of Custody:** Documentation tracking evidence handling throughout an investigation

**Covert Channel:** A communication path that was not designed for information transfer but can be exploited for that purpose

**Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Network analysis technique that examines the data part of packets, not just headers

**Entropy:** Measure of randomness in data; high entropy may indicate encryption or steganography

**Exfiltration:** Unauthorized transfer of data from a system

**Least Significant Bit (LSB):** The bit position in a binary number with the lowest value; commonly manipulated in steganography

**Steganalysis:** The study and practice of detecting steganography

**Tunneling:** Encapsulating one protocol within another to create a covert communication channel

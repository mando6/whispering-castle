**Question 1: D) Layer 7 (Application)**  
*Explanation:* HTTP operates at the Application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. While layers 3 and 4 are necessary for understanding routing and connections, the actual user actions (web requests, form submissions, etc.) are visible at Layer 7.

**Question 2: B) The beginning of a TCP session**  
*Explanation:* The three-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) is how TCP establishes a connection between client and server. This marks the start of a TCP session, not the end.

**Question 3: C) A sustained HTTP response with significant data transfer**  
*Explanation:* File downloads are HTTP responses (from server to client) containing the file data. Large HTTP POST requests indicate uploads. Sustained responses with large data transfers are the hallmark of downloads.

**Question 4: C) MAIL FROM**  
*Explanation:* In SMTP protocol, MAIL FROM specifies the sender's email address, while RCPT TO specifies recipients. DATA introduces the message content, and HELO/EHLO initiates the SMTP session.

**Question 5: A) Using the server's private RSA key**  
*Explanation:* With Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), session keys are ephemeral and not derived from the server's private key. Even with the private key, you cannot decrypt past sessions. Session key logging or SSL proxies are required for PFS-protected traffic.

**Question 6: C) Login → Download 2GB from file server → Upload 2GB to cloud storage → Clear browser history → Logout**  
*Explanation:* This sequence shows clear signs of data exfiltration: accessing large amounts of data, transferring to external storage, and attempting to cover tracks by clearing history. The matching file sizes are particularly suspicious.

**Question 7: B) NetFlow requires significantly less storage space**  
*Explanation:* NetFlow captures metadata (source/dest IPs, ports, protocols, byte counts, timestamps) but not full packet payloads. This dramatically reduces storage requirements while still providing valuable traffic analysis capabilities.

**Question 8: C) Possible malware beaconing/command-and-control**  
*Explanation:* Regular, periodic connections with small packet sizes to external IPs is a classic indicator of malware "calling home" to a command-and-control server. The consistency and timing pattern are key indicators.

**Question 9: B) Possible brute force attack**  
*Explanation:* Multiple authentication attempts with different usernames, all receiving 401 Unauthorized responses, indicates someone is trying different credentials to gain access—a brute force attack pattern.

**Question 10: C) Wireshark or NetworkMiner**  
*Explanation:* Both Wireshark (File → Export Objects → HTTP) and NetworkMiner have built-in capabilities to automatically identify and extract files from packet captures. tcpdump captures packets but doesn't extract files; nmap is a network scanner; netstat shows active connections.

**Question 11: B) Possible DNS tunneling for data exfiltration**  
*Explanation:* High-entropy domain names with random-looking characters can indicate DNS tunneling, where data is encoded in DNS queries/responses to bypass security controls. This is a data exfiltration technique.

**Question 12: B) Obtaining proper authorization and ensuring compliance with legal requirements**  
*Explanation:* Legal authorization is paramount. Network monitoring may violate privacy laws, wiretapping statutes, or employment agreements without proper authorization. Technical capabilities are useless if evidence is inadmissible.

**Question 13: C) Connection timing, duration, and endpoints**  
*Explanation:* RDP traffic is encrypted, so you cannot see screen contents, keystrokes, or specific files. However, metadata (when connected, how long, from where, to where) is visible and valuable for investigation.

**Question 14: B) This could be legitimate alternative configuration or potential protocol tunneling**  
*Explanation:* While unusual, non-standard ports can be legitimate configurations. However, investigators should examine this traffic closely as it could also indicate protocol tunneling to evade detection. Context matters.

**Question 15: B) Data from client to server (red) and server to client (blue), or vice versa**  
*Explanation:* Wireshark's "Follow TCP Stream" feature uses colors to differentiate directionality—typically one direction is red and the other is blue, making it easy to see the conversation flow.

### Scenario-Based Answers

**Question 16: D) Malicious email attachment downloaded via HTTP (document.pdf.exe)**  
*Explanation:* The timeline clearly shows an executable file disguised as a PDF being downloaded. The ".exe" extension and the immediate suspicious behavior afterward (DNS query to a suspicious domain) indicate this was the infection vector.

**Question 17: B) Command-and-control beaconing/heartbeat**  
*Explanation:* Regular, consistent, small packets at precise intervals (every 60 seconds) to an external IP immediately after infection is textbook C2 beaconing behavior. The malware is maintaining contact with its control server.

**Question 18: E) All of the above**  
*Explanation:* This timeline demonstrates a complete attack chain:
- Initial infection: Malicious executable download
- C2 communication: Regular beaconing
- Additional payload: Larger download likely contained additional tools/commands
- Lateral movement: SMB connections to other internal hosts
- Data exfiltration: Large upload to C2 server

**Question 19: B) The timing (late night), volume of data, and sequence of file access followed by external upload**  
*Explanation:* Multiple factors make this suspicious: (1) Activity outside normal work hours, (2) Access to sensitive financial data, (3) Large volume transfer, (4) Immediate upload to external storage service, (5) Matching data volumes suggesting direct data theft. Any one factor might be explainable; together they indicate intentional data exfiltration.

**Question 20: C) Preserve evidence, document findings, and follow incident response procedures**  
*Explanation:* Proper forensic procedure requires evidence preservation first. Confronting the user or taking reactive actions could compromise evidence or tip off the subject. Following established incident response procedures ensures proper handling, legal compliance, and evidence admissibility.

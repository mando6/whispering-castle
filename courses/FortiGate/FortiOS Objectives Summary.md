## 1. System and Network Settings

### Objective: Configure FortiGate basic networking from factory default settings

FortiGate devices ship with factory default settings that require initial configuration to become operational in a production environment. This process involves accessing the device through the console port or default management interface, configuring network interfaces with appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks, setting the default gateway, and establishing DNS servers. The initial setup includes defining internal and external interfaces, configuring DHCP server settings if required, and establishing basic connectivity. FortiOS provides both a setup wizard and manual configuration options to streamline this process. Understanding the default IP address (typically 192.168.1.99) and credentials is essential for initial access.

### Objective: Configure and control administrator access to FortiGate

Administrator access control is critical for FortiGate security and involves creating administrator accounts with specific privileges, defining trusted hosts that can access the management interface, and configuring access profiles that determine what each administrator can view and modify. FortiOS supports multiple administrator types including local administrators, RADIUS-authenticated administrators, and LDAP-authenticated administrators. Access can be restricted by source IP address, allowing connections only from specific management networks. Administrators can be granted full access or limited to specific virtual domains (VDOMs) in multi-tenant environments. Two-factor authentication can be enabled for enhanced security, and administrator sessions can be monitored and terminated if necessary.

### Objective: Use the GUI and CLI for administration

FortiGate provides two primary management interfaces: the graphical user interface (GUI) accessed through HTTPS on a web browser, and the command-line interface (CLI) accessed through SSH, Telnet, or console connection. The GUI offers an intuitive, menu-driven approach ideal for configuration tasks, dashboard monitoring, and log analysis with visual representations. The CLI provides powerful scripting capabilities, faster configuration for repetitive tasks, and access to advanced features not available in the GUI. Both interfaces provide complete access to FortiGate functionality, though some advanced diagnostics and troubleshooting commands are CLI-exclusive. Understanding when to use each interface optimizes administrative efficiency—GUI for visual tasks and initial configuration, CLI for automation, bulk changes, and advanced troubleshooting.

### Objective: Describe methods of device registration

FortiGate device registration activates support contracts, enables FortiGuard security services, and provides access to firmware updates. Registration can be performed through FortiCloud, which provides centralized management and zero-touch provisioning capabilities. Alternative registration methods include direct registration through the FortiGate GUI by entering the serial number and authentication code, or through FortiManager for centralized device management. Registration links the device to a FortiCare support contract, activating antivirus, web filtering, IPS signatures, and other FortiGuard services. Organizations can also use FortiDeploy for automated device provisioning and registration in large-scale deployments.

## 2. Logging and Monitoring

### Objective: View and search for logs on FortiGate and FortiAnalyzer

FortiGate generates comprehensive logs categorizing traffic (allowed/denied connections), events (system changes, administrator actions), security events (threats detected), and application usage. Logs can be viewed directly on the FortiGate through the GUI's Log & Report section or accessed via CLI commands. FortiAnalyzer serves as a centralized log management solution, collecting logs from multiple FortiGate devices and providing advanced search, filtering, and correlation capabilities. Log searches can be refined using filters such as source/destination IP addresses, time ranges, policy IDs, applications, users, and threat signatures. FortiAnalyzer offers SQL-based queries for complex log analysis, pre-built and custom reports, real-time log monitoring, and long-term log retention with compression. Understanding log types and search syntax is essential for security investigations, compliance auditing, and troubleshooting network issues.

## 3. Firewall Policies and NAT

### Objective: Configure IPv4 firewall policies

IPv4 firewall policies are the fundamental security controls in FortiGate, determining which traffic is allowed or denied between network interfaces. Policies are evaluated in sequential order from top to bottom, with the first matching policy determining the action. Each policy defines source and destination interfaces, source and destination addresses (IP addresses, subnets, or address objects), services (ports and protocols), users or user groups, schedule (time-based access control), and action (accept, deny, or IPsec VPN). Policies can include security profiles (antivirus, web filtering, IPS, application control) to inspect allowed traffic for threats. NAT settings can be enabled within policies for address translation. Policy configuration includes logging options (all sessions, security events only, or no logging) and traffic shaping for bandwidth management. Implicit deny rules ensure that traffic not explicitly permitted is automatically blocked.

### Objective: Apply port forwarding, source NAT, and destination NAT

Network Address Translation (NAT) is essential for conserving public IP addresses and securing private networks. **Port forwarding** (a type of destination NAT) allows external users to access internal servers by mapping a public IP and port to an internal IP and port, commonly used for web servers, email servers, and remote access applications. **Source NAT (SNAT)** modifies the source IP address of outbound traffic, typically translating private internal addresses to a public IP address for internet access; FortiGate can use IP pools or interface IP for SNAT. **Destination NAT (DNAT)** changes the destination IP address of inbound traffic, redirecting external requests to internal resources. FortiOS implements NAT through Virtual IPs (VIPs) for destination NAT and IP pools for source NAT. Central NAT and firewall policy-based NAT provide flexible implementation options. Understanding NAT traversal for VPN and VoIP applications is crucial for maintaining connectivity through address translation.

## 4. Routing

### Objective: Analyze a FortiGate route table

The FortiGate route table contains all routing information the device uses to forward packets, including connected routes (directly attached networks), static routes (manually configured), and dynamic routes (learned through routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, or RIP). Analyzing the route table involves using CLI commands such as `get router info routing-table all` to view all routes or `get router info routing-table database` for detailed route information. Each route entry displays destination network, subnet mask, gateway, interface, distance (administrative distance), metric, and protocol. Understanding route selection criteria is essential—FortiGate selects routes based on longest prefix match first, then administrative distance (lower is preferred), then metric. The route table analysis identifies routing loops, suboptimal paths, missing routes causing connectivity issues, and route preference when multiple paths exist to the same destination.

### Objective: Configure static routing

Static routing in FortiGate involves manually defining routes to specific networks, providing precise control over traffic paths. Static routes are configured by specifying the destination network/subnet, gateway IP address (next-hop), and outgoing interface. Static routes are ideal for small networks with stable topologies, backup routes, and routes to specific subnets not advertised by dynamic routing protocols. FortiOS allows configuring multiple static routes to the same destination with different priorities, enabling route redundancy. Administrative distance can be adjusted to prefer certain paths over others. Static routes can specify SD-WAN zones as gateways for policy-based routing. Black hole routes can be created for traffic filtering by routing unwanted traffic to a null interface. Static routing requires no routing protocol overhead but lacks automatic convergence during network topology changes.

### Objective: Implement route redundancy and load balancing

Route redundancy ensures network availability by providing backup paths when primary routes fail, while load balancing distributes traffic across multiple paths for improved performance and bandwidth utilization. **Route redundancy** is achieved through equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing, where multiple routes with the same administrative distance and metric are installed, or through floating static routes with higher administrative distance that activate when primary routes fail. Link health monitoring continuously checks route availability. **Load balancing** can be implemented using per-packet, per-session (source IP-based), or weighted load balancing methods. FortiGate supports source-based load balancing where traffic from the same source uses the same path (maintaining session persistence) or per-packet distribution for maximum throughput. SD-WAN enhances both capabilities with intelligent path selection based on application requirements, link performance, and business policies, automatically steering traffic away from degraded links.

## 5. Firewall Authentication

### Objective: Configure a remote LDAP and RADIUS authentication server on FortiGate

FortiGate integrates with external authentication servers to centralize user credential management and leverage existing identity infrastructures. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** configuration connects FortiGate to directory services like Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP. Configuration requires the LDAP server IP address, port (389 for standard, 636 for LDAPS), Common Name (CN) and Distinguished Name (DN) for the user base, bind DN and password for FortiGate to query the directory, and optionally group membership filters. **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)** configuration involves specifying the RADIUS server IP address, shared secret for secure communication, authentication port (typically 1812), and optional accounting port. Both protocols support two-factor authentication integration. LDAP is often preferred for firewall authentication and FSSO integration, while RADIUS is commonly used for VPN authentication, wireless authentication (802.1X), and administrator authentication with support for additional attributes like VLAN assignment.

### Objective: Monitor firewall users from the FortiGate GUI

FortiGate provides real-time visibility into authenticated users accessing network resources through the GUI's user monitoring features. The User & Device monitor displays currently authenticated users, their IP addresses, authentication method (FSSO, firewall authentication, or explicit web proxy), login time, group memberships, and active sessions. Administrators can view detailed session information for each user, including bandwidth consumption, applications accessed, websites visited, and security events triggered. The GUI allows manually deauthenticating users to immediately revoke access, useful for security incidents or troubleshooting. Historical user activity can be reviewed through logs filtered by username. Dashboard widgets provide summary statistics on user counts, top users by bandwidth or sessions, and authentication failures. This visibility enables enforcing acceptable use policies, investigating security incidents, troubleshooting user connectivity issues, and capacity planning based on user activity patterns.

## 6. Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO)

### Objective: Deploy Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO) access to network services, integrated with Microsoft Active Directory (AD)

FSSO eliminates the need for separate firewall authentication by leveraging existing Windows Active Directory credentials, providing seamless, identity-based access control. FSSO deployment involves installing the FSSO Collector Agent on a Windows server within the AD domain, which monitors domain controller logon events to create IP-to-username mappings. The Collector Agent communicates with FortiGate, sending real-time user login information. FortiGate then applies firewall policies based on user identity and AD group membership rather than just IP addresses. FSSO supports multiple collection methods including DC Agent mode (polling domain controllers), advanced polling mode, and workstation check for enhanced accuracy. Group filtering allows selecting specific AD groups for monitoring. FSSO enables context-aware security policies, such as allowing sales team members to access CRM systems while restricting other departments. Benefits include transparent authentication (users log in once to Windows), centralized user management through AD, granular policy control based on user/group identity, and comprehensive user-based logging for auditing and compliance.

## 7. Certificate Operations

### Objective: Describe encryption functions and certificates

Digital certificates are electronic documents that verify identity and enable encryption in FortiGate operations. Certificates use public key infrastructure (PKI) based on asymmetric encryption, where a key pair (public and private keys) is mathematically linked. The public key encrypts data or verifies signatures, while the private key decrypts data or creates signatures. Certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that vouch for the certificate holder's identity. **Encryption functions** include symmetric encryption (same key for encryption/decryption, fast but requires secure key exchange) and asymmetric encryption (different keys, slower but enables secure key exchange). FortiGate uses certificates for SSL/TLS connections to the management interface, IPsec VPN authentication, SSL VPN authentication, and SSL inspection. Certificate components include subject name (identity), issuer (CA), validity period, public key, and digital signature. Certificate chains establish trust from end-entity certificates up to trusted root CAs. FortiGate can generate certificate signing requests (CSRs), import certificates from external CAs, or act as a local CA for internal certificate issuance.

### Objective: Describe SSL inspection on FortiGate

SSL inspection (also called SSL/TLS inspection or HTTPS inspection) allows FortiGate to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt encrypted traffic to detect threats hidden within SSL/TLS sessions. Without SSL inspection, antivirus, web filtering, IPS, and DLP cannot examine encrypted content, creating security blind spots. FortiGate supports three SSL inspection modes: **Certificate Inspection** (examines certificate validity without decrypting payload, minimal performance impact), **Deep Inspection** (full man-in-the-middle decryption and content inspection, requires deploying FortiGate CA certificate to clients), and **No Inspection** (bypasses SSL inspection for specific sites). Deep inspection involves FortiGate decrypting client traffic, inspecting content with security profiles, then re-encrypting with a dynamically generated certificate signed by the FortiGate CA. SSL inspection profiles define which traffic to inspect based on destination, protocol, and port. Challenges include certificate trust warnings if CA not properly deployed, performance considerations for high-throughput environments, and privacy concerns requiring exemption lists for sensitive sites like banking or healthcare.

## 8. Antivirus

### Objective: Configure security profiles to neutralize threats and misuse, including viruses (antivirus)

FortiGate antivirus protection defends against malware, viruses, worms, trojans, and other malicious software traversing the network. Antivirus profiles utilize FortiGuard threat intelligence providing real-time signature updates and cloud-based outbreak detection. FortiOS offers two scanning modes: **Proxy-based scanning** buffers entire files before scanning, providing thorough inspection but requiring more memory and latency; **Flow-based scanning** scans data streams in real-time with lower latency but may miss threats in partial transfers. Antivirus inspection supports multiple protocols including HTTP, HTTPS (with SSL inspection), FTP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, MAPI, and CIFS. Configuration options include scanning only compressed files or all traffic, file size limits for scanning, blocking or monitoring specific file types, and quarantine options for infected files. Outbreak prevention identifies anomalous file behavior even without specific signatures. Antivirus logs provide detailed threat information including file names, threat names, severity, source/destination, and action taken (blocked, quarantined, or monitored). Regular FortiGuard signature updates ensure protection against emerging threats.

## 9. Web Filtering

### Objective: Configure security profiles to neutralize threats and misuse, including inappropriate websites (web filtering)

Web filtering controls user access to websites based on categories, URLs, or content, enforcing acceptable use policies and preventing access to malicious or inappropriate sites. FortiGate web filtering leverages FortiGuard Web Filtering Service, which categorizes billions of websites into over 80 categories including malicious websites, adult content, social networking, gambling, peer-to-peer file sharing, and business categories like banking and shopping. Web filtering profiles define actions for each category: allow, block, monitor, warning (user can proceed after warning), or authenticate (require authentication to access). **Static URL filtering** creates custom allow/block lists for specific URLs or domains, overriding FortiGuard categories. **Content filtering** blocks pages containing specific keywords or patterns. **File type filtering** restricts downloads of specific file extensions. **FortiGuard quota** enforces time-based access limits for specific categories. Web filtering supports **safe search** enforcement for search engines, **YouTube filtering** by category or channel, and **application-based filtering** for social media controls. Time-based policies allow restricting access during work hours while permitting after-hours access. Web filtering reduces security risks from malicious sites, improves productivity by limiting non-business browsing, and helps meet compliance requirements for content filtering.

### Objective: Configure security profiles to neutralize threats including torrents (web filtering)

Torrent and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications pose security risks including malware distribution, intellectual property violations, bandwidth consumption, and policy violations. FortiGate addresses P2P threats through multiple mechanisms. **Web filtering** blocks the "Peer-to-Peer/Freeware" FortiGuard category, preventing access to torrent websites and file-sharing portals. However, web filtering alone is insufficient since torrent clients operate using proprietary protocols on various ports, not just HTTP/HTTPS. **Application control** provides comprehensive P2P blocking by identifying torrent applications (BitTorrent, uTorrent, etc.) regardless of port or protocol using deep packet inspection and behavioral analysis. Application control profiles can block all P2P applications, monitor usage without blocking, or apply rate limiting to control bandwidth. Combining web filtering (blocks torrent sites) with application control (blocks torrent client traffic) provides layered defense. DLP profiles can prevent unauthorized file uploads. Traffic logs identify users attempting P2P activity, enabling policy enforcement and user education about acceptable use policies.

## 10. Intrusion Prevention and Application Control

### Objective: Apply application control techniques to monitor and control network applications that might use standard or non-standard protocols and ports

Application control in FortiGate identifies, monitors, and controls applications regardless of port, protocol, or encryption, overcoming limitations of traditional port-based filtering. Modern applications use dynamic ports, tunnel through HTTP/HTTPS, or employ encryption to bypass basic firewall rules. FortiGate application control uses deep packet inspection (DPI) analyzing packet payloads, protocol behaviors, and traffic patterns to identify applications using a constantly updated signature database from FortiGuard. Application control capabilities include **identification** (detects thousands of applications across categories like social media, P2P, streaming, remote access, cloud storage), **action enforcement** (allow, block, monitor, quarantine), **traffic shaping** (prioritize or rate-limit specific applications), **application overrides** (different actions based on subcategories, such as allowing some social media while blocking file transfer features), and **logging** (detailed application usage reporting). Application control addresses security challenges like unauthorized cloud storage usage risking data loss, productivity concerns from streaming media and gaming, bandwidth management for VoIP and video conferencing priority, and shadow IT visibility. Policies apply application control profiles to traffic, with actions logged for compliance and usage analysis. Regular signature updates ensure coverage of new applications.

## 11. IPsec VPN

### Objective: Configure IPsec VPN using the IPsec wizard and manual process

IPsec VPN provides secure encrypted tunnels for site-to-site connectivity or remote access, protecting data confidentiality and integrity across untrusted networks. FortiGate offers two configuration approaches: **IPsec VPN Wizard** streamlines setup through guided steps, automatically configuring matching Phase 1 and Phase 2 parameters, creating necessary firewall policies and routes for common scenarios like site-to-site or remote access VPN. The wizard simplifies complex configurations for standard deployments. **Manual configuration** provides complete control over all parameters, necessary for advanced scenarios, non-standard configurations, or troubleshooting. IPsec configuration involves two phases: **Phase 1** (IKE Security Association) establishes the secure management connection, negotiating encryption algorithms (DES, 3DES, AES), authentication methods (pre-shared key or certificates), Diffie-Hellman groups, and authentication hashes (MD5, SHA). **Phase 2** (IPsec Security Association) defines the actual data encryption tunnel parameters, including encryption/authentication protocols (ESP or AH), tunnel or transport mode, selectors (traffic to be encrypted), and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) settings. Route-based VPNs create virtual IPsec interfaces enabling dynamic routing, while policy-based VPNs encrypt traffic matching specific selectors. Post-configuration verification includes checking tunnel status, testing connectivity, and reviewing VPN logs.

## 12. SD-WAN Configuration and Monitoring

### Objective: Configure SD-WAN and verify traffic distribution

SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) in FortiGate optimizes WAN connectivity by intelligently steering traffic across multiple links based on application requirements, link performance, and business policies. SD-WAN configuration begins with defining **SD-WAN members** (WAN interfaces or VPN tunnels), each assigned a **cost** and **priority**. **Performance SLAs** continuously monitor link quality measuring latency, jitter, packet loss, and optionally bandwidth, marking links as "alive" or "dead." SD-WAN **rules** define traffic steering policies matching specific applications, services, or sources to route traffic optimally—options include lowest-cost path (prefer cheaper links), best quality (lowest latency/jitter), maximum bandwidth, or load balancing across multiple links. Advanced features include **application-based routing** (route Office 365 via premium link, general browsing via broadband), **manual steering** (critical traffic to MPLS, backup to LTE), **health monitoring** (automatic failover when SLAs violated), and **traffic shaping** within SD-WAN zones. **Verification** involves Dashboard SD-WAN widgets showing member status and traffic distribution, logging showing which rules matched traffic and path selection decisions, CLI commands displaying real-time SD-WAN status and statistics, and application bandwidth monitors confirming traffic follows intended paths. SD-WAN improves application performance, optimizes WAN costs by using multiple link types, provides automatic failover, and simplifies multi-site deployments with consistent policies.

## 13. High Availability

### Objective: Identify the primary and secondary device tasks in an HA cluster

FortiGate High Availability (HA) ensures network continuity by automatically failing over to redundant devices during hardware failures, software issues, or link failures. In an HA cluster, roles are clearly defined: **Primary device** actively processes all traffic, enforces security policies, maintains state tables (sessions, NAT connections), manages configuration synchronization to secondary devices, responds to management connections, and sends heartbeat signals indicating operational status. **Secondary device(s)** remain synchronized with the primary, continuously receiving configuration updates and state synchronization data, monitoring primary device health through heartbeat links, and standing ready for immediate takeover. Upon primary failure, a secondary device promotes itself to primary role based on election criteria (device priority, port monitoring status, uptime), assumes the primary's IP and MAC addresses (gratuitous ARP ensures transparent failover), and begins processing traffic with minimal disruption. Secondary devices continue monitoring for primary recovery. Configuration changes must be made on the primary device only and automatically replicate to secondaries. Both devices maintain identical configurations except for hostname and some device-specific settings. HA cluster monitoring displays synchronization status, failover events, and individual device health.

### Objective: Identify the different operation modes for HA with the FortiGate Clustering Protocol (FGCP)

FGCP (FortiGate Clustering Protocol) provides HA clustering with multiple operation modes suited for different deployment scenarios. **Active-Passive (A-P) mode** designates one device as active (processing traffic) while others remain passive (standby), ensuring immediate failover. This mode provides maximum compatibility with network devices expecting single MAC addresses and conserves licenses since only the active device counts against licensing. **Active-Active (A-A) mode** allows all cluster members to simultaneously process traffic, effectively load-balancing workloads for improved performance and resource utilization. Traffic distribution occurs via FGCP load balancing based on session setup. A-A mode requires more complex network design (typically requiring switches that support clustering or multiple VLANs). Both modes support **session synchronization** maintaining active connections during failover for connection-oriented protocols. **Operation mode selection** depends on throughput requirements (A-A for high throughput), network topology, and desired simplicity (A-P simpler). Additional HA features include **configuration synchronization** (real-time replication of changes), **link monitoring** (monitor critical interfaces and fail over if they fail), **remote link monitoring** (fail over if remote hosts become unreachable), and **virtual clustering** (multiple VDOMs in separate HA clusters on same physical devices). FortiOS 7.x introduces enhanced A-A mode with improved session synchronization and failover capabilities.

## 14. Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

### Objective: Diagnose and correct common problems

Effective FortiGate troubleshooting requires systematic methodology and familiarity with diagnostic tools. **Common connectivity issues** include incorrect interface configurations (IP address, subnet), missing or incorrect routes, firewall policies blocking traffic, or failed interfaces. **Diagnostic approach** follows logical layers: physical (link status, cable connectivity), network (routing, ARP), transport (port accessibility), and application (service availability). **Essential CLI diagnostic commands** include `execute ping` and `execute traceroute` for network connectivity verification, `diagnose debug flow` for real-time packet flow analysis showing policy matches and drop reasons, `diagnose sniffer packet` for packet capture similar to tcpdump, `get system performance status` for resource utilization, and `diagnose hardware deviceinfo nic` for interface statistics. **Common problems and solutions**: traffic blocked by policies requires reviewing policy order and implicit deny logs, NAT issues need validation of VIP configurations and NAT traversal, routing problems require route table analysis and gateway reachability verification, VPN failures need Phase 1/Phase 2 debugging and IKE log review, performance degradation requires resource monitoring and security profile optimization, authentication failures need RADIUS/LDAP server connectivity tests, and HA failover issues require heartbeat link verification and priority validation. **Best practices** include enabling logging for troubleshooting policies, maintaining systematic documentation, creating baseline configurations for comparison, and utilizing FortiGate support resources including knowledge base articles and technical support.

## 15. FortiGate in the Cloud

### Objective: Identify FortiGate VM and FortiGate CNF in the cloud

FortiGate extends security to cloud environments through virtualized form factors providing consistent security policies across on-premises and cloud deployments. **FortiGate VM (Virtual Machine)** is a software-based FortiGate instance running on hypervisors including VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, Citrix Xen, and public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). FortiGate VM provides identical features as physical appliances including firewall policies, VPN, antivirus, IPS, web filtering, application control, and SD-WAN. Licensing models include PAYG (pay-as-you-go, metered by cloud provider), BYOL (bring your own license, fixed contract), and FortiFlex (consumption-based flexible licensing). Use cases include securing cloud workloads, hybrid cloud connectivity via IPsec VPN, multi-cloud security consistency, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) protection. **FortiGate CNF (Cloud-Native Firewall)** represents next-generation cloud security designed specifically for modern containerized and serverless architectures. CNF provides elastic scaling responding to demand automatically, serverless deployment without VM management overhead, container security for Kubernetes environments, and cloud-native integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP services. CNF deployment uses infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation), API-driven management, and micro-segmentation for granular security. Cloud deployment considerations include network architecture (hub-spoke, transit VPC, security VPC), high availability configurations, auto-scaling policies, logging/monitoring integration with cloud-native tools, and cost optimization through appropriate instance sizing.

## 16. FortiSASE

### Objective: Identify FortiSASE and various FortiSASE use cases

FortiSASE (Fortinet Secure Access Service Edge) converges networking and security into a unified cloud-delivered service, addressing modern distributed workforce and multi-cloud architecture security challenges. FortiSASE integrates **SD-WAN** for optimized connectivity with **SASE capabilities** including firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS), secure web gateway (SWG), cloud access security broker (CASB), zero trust network access (ZTNA), and data loss prevention (DLP), all delivered from Fortinet's global points of presence. Architecture eliminates the need for backhauling traffic to centralized data centers, instead routing users directly to cloud applications via the nearest FortiSASE point of presence with security inspection en route. **Common use cases** include: **Remote worker security** providing secure access to corporate resources and internet for work-from-home employees without VPN complexities, **Branch office connectivity** replacing costly MPLS with secure SD-WAN to cloud and headquarters, **Cloud application security** inspecting and controlling access to SaaS applications (Office 365, Salesforce, Workday) with CASB policies, **ZTNA implementation** enforcing identity-based, context-aware access controls replacing traditional VPN, **Multi-cloud security** consistent policies across AWS, Azure, and GCP workloads, and **Mobile workforce** securing laptops, smartphones, and tablets regardless of location. Benefits include reduced complexity by consolidating multiple point solutions, improved performance with local breakout to internet and cloud apps, reduced costs eliminating multiple vendor contracts and MPLS dependency, scalability to support organizational growth, and consistent security enforcement across all users, locations, and clouds. FortiSASE management via Fortinet Security Fabric provides unified visibility and control.

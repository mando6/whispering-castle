PGP remains one of the most important cryptographic systems ever developed, not just for its technical innovations but for its impact on digital privacy rights. While newer systems may be more user-friendly or technically advanced, understanding PGP provides crucial insights into:

- The fundamental challenges of secure communication
- The importance of key management in cryptographic systems
- The trade-offs between security, usability, and decentralization
- The ongoing evolution of cryptographic practice

The principles learned in this course apply broadly to modern cryptographic systems and will serve as a foundation for understanding future developments in secure communications.

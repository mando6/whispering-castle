### Comprehensive Final Exam

**Part A: Conceptual Understanding**
1. Explain how RSA solves the key distribution problem that existed in symmetric cryptography.

2. Describe the mathematical relationship between RSA encryption and decryption, including why the algorithm works.

3. Compare and contrast RSA encryption with RSA digital signatures, explaining when you would use each.

4. Analyze the security trade-offs between key size and performance in RSA implementations.

**Part B: Mathematical Application**
5.  Generate an RSA key pair with p = 23, q = 29. Show all steps and verify your answer.

6. Using your generated key pair, encrypt the message M = 100, then decrypt the result to verify correctness.

**Part C: Practical Implementation**
7.  Identify three security vulnerabilities in RSA implementations and suggest mitigations.

8.  Design a secure system for digital document signing using RSA, addressing key management and verification processes.

9.  Explain how RSA might be used in a hybrid cryptosystem for secure messaging, including performance considerations.

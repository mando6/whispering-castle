### Core Topic: Securing PKI Infrastructure

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify PKI security threats and vulnerabilities
- Implement PKI security best practices
- Understand compliance requirements

### Lesson Content

#### PKI Security Threats

**Connection to PKI:** Security is fundamental to PKI effectiveness. If PKI components are compromised, the entire trust infrastructure fails.

**Primary Threat Categories:**

**1. CA Compromise**
- Root CA private key theft
- Rogue certificate issuance
- Impact: Complete trust breakdown

**2. Certificate-related Attacks**
- Certificate spoofing
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Weak certificate validation

**3. Implementation Vulnerabilities**
- Poor key storage
- Inadequate access controls
- Software vulnerabilities

#### Security Best Practices

**CA Security Hardening:**
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage
- Air-gapped root CA systems
- Multi-person authentication
- Regular security audits

**Certificate Management:**
- Strong certificate policies
- Regular certificate renewal
- Proper revocation procedures
- Certificate transparency logging

**System Security:**
- Regular security updates
- Network segmentation
- Intrusion detection systems
- Backup and recovery procedures

#### Compliance Frameworks

**Common Standards:**
- **Common Criteria:** Security evaluation standard
- **FIPS 140-2:** Cryptographic module standards
- **WebTrust:** CA audit framework
- **RFC 3647:** Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement Framework

- Common Criteria Protection Profiles for PKI

### Risk Assessment Exercise
Conduct a risk assessment for a hypothetical PKI deployment:
1. Identify assets
2. Identify threats
3. Assess vulnerabilities
4. Determine risk levels
5. Propose mitigations

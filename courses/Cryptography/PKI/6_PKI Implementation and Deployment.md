### Core Topic: Practical PKI System Deployment

**Learning Objectives:**
- Design PKI architectures for different environments
- Understand PKI integration challenges
- Plan PKI deployment strategies

### Lesson Content

#### PKI Architecture Design

**Connection to PKI:** Implementation decisions directly impact PKI security, performance, and usability. Poor design choices can compromise the entire PKI system.

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Trust model selection
- CA hierarchy structure
- Certificate policies and practices
- Key management strategies
- Integration with existing systems

#### Common PKI Implementations

**1. Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services**
- Windows-integrated PKI
- Auto-enrollment capabilities
- Group Policy integration

**2. OpenSSL-based Solutions**
- Open source flexibility
- Custom implementation options
- Command-line management

**3. Commercial PKI Solutions**
- Vendor support and features
- Enterprise-grade management
- Compliance certifications

#### Deployment Phases

**Phase 1: Planning and Design**
- Requirements analysis
- Risk assessment
- Policy development
- Architecture design

**Phase 2: Pilot Implementation**
- Small-scale deployment
- Testing and validation
- Process refinement

**Phase 3: Production Rollout**
- Phased deployment
- User training
- Monitoring and support

**Phase 4: Operations and Maintenance**
- Ongoing management
- Security monitoring
- Performance optimization

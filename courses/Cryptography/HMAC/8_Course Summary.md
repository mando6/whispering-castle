### Key Takeaways
1. **HMAC solves real security problems** that simple hash constructions cannot address
2. **The nested construction** with different padding constants provides provable security
3. **Implementation details matter** - constant-time comparison, proper key management
4. **HMAC is widely deployed** in protocols and systems you use every day

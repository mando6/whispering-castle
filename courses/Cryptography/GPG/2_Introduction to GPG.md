### Learning Goals
- Understand what GPG is and its history
- Recognize GPG's place in the cryptographic ecosystem
- Identify common use cases for GPG

### Core Content

#### 2.1 What is GPG?
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is a free, open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880). It provides:
- Email encryption and signing
- File encryption and signing
- Key management
- Integration with various applications

#### 2.2 History and Context
- **1991**: Phil Zimmermann creates PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
- **1997**: OpenPGP standard developed (RFC 2440, later RFC 4880)
- **1999**: GPG created as free alternative to PGP
- **Present**: Widely used for secure communications

#### 2.3 GPG vs Other Tools
**GPG vs SSL/TLS:**
- GPG: End-to-end encryption, user controls keys
- SSL/TLS: Transport layer security, CA-based trust

**GPG vs Modern Messaging Apps:**
- GPG: Universal, standards-based, full user control
- Messaging Apps: Easier to use, but platform-specific

### Connection to Main Topic
GPG represents a practical implementation of the cryptographic principles from Module 1. It demonstrates how public key cryptography, symmetric encryption, and digital signatures work together in real-world applications.

### Knowledge Check 2
